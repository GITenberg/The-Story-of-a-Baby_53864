 /><small>THE BURDEN OF IT</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Larrie</span> had been carrying it for a long way
and said it was quite time Dot took her turn.</p>

<p>Dot was arguing the point.</p>

<p>She reminded him of all athletic sports he
had taken part in, and of all the prizes he had
won; she asked him what was the use of
being six-foot-two and an impossible number
of inches round the chest if he could not carry
a baby.</p>

<p>Larrie gave her an unexpected glance and
moved the baby to his other arm; he was
heated and unhappy, there seemed absolutely
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>no end to the red, red road they were traversing,
and Dot, as well as refusing to help to
carry the burden, laughed aggravatingly at
him when he said it was heavy.</p>

<p>‘He is exactly twenty-one pounds,’ she
said, ‘I weighed him on the kitchen scales
yesterday, I should think a man of your size
ought to be able to carry twenty-one pounds
without grumbling so.’</p>

<p>‘But he’s on springs, Dot,’ he said, ‘just
look at him, he’s never still for a minute, you
carry him to the beginning of Lee’s orchard,
and then I’ll take him again.’</p>

<p>Dot shook her head.</p>

<p>‘I’m very sorry, Larrie,’ she said, ‘but I
really can’t. You know I didn’t want to
bring the child, and when you insisted, I said
to myself, you should carry him every inch
of the way, just for your obstinacy.’</p>

<p>‘But you’re his mother,’ objected Larrie.</p>

<p>He was getting seriously angry, his arms
ached unutterably, his clothes were sticking
to his back, and twice the baby had poked a
little fat thumb in his eye and made it water.</p>

<p><a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>3<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘But you’re its father,’ Dot said sweetly.</p>

<p>‘It’s easier for a woman to carry a child
than a man’—poor Larrie was mopping his
hot brow with his disengaged hand—‘everyone
says so; don’t be a little sneak, Dot,
my arm’s getting awfully cramped; here, for
pity’s sake take him.’</p>

<p>Dot shook her head again.</p>

<p>‘Would you have me break my vow, St
Lawrence?’ she said.</p>

<p>She looked provokingly cool and unruffled
as she walked along by his side; her gown
was white, with transparent puffy sleeves, her
hat was white and very large, she had little
white canvas shoes, long white Suéde gloves,
and she carried a white parasol.</p>

<p>‘I’m hanged,’ said Larrie, and he stopped
short in the middle of the road, ‘look here,
my good woman, are you going to take your
baby, or are you not?’</p>

<p>Dot revolved her sunshade round her little
sweet face.</p>

<p>‘No, my good man,’ she said, ‘I don’t
propose to carry your baby one step.’</p>

<p><a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>4<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘Then I shall drop it,’ said Larrie. He
held it up in a threatening position by the
back of its crumpled coat, but Dot had gone
sailing on.</p>

<p>‘Find a soft place,’ she called, looking back
over her shoulder once and seeing him still
standing in the road.</p>

<p>‘Little minx,’ he said under his breath.</p>

<p>Then his mouth squared itself; ordinarily
it was a pleasant mouth, much given to
laughter and merry words; but when it took
that obstinate look, one could see capabilities
for all manner of things.</p>

<p>He looked carefully around. By the roadside
there was a patch of soft, green grass, and
a wattle bush, yellow-crowned, beautiful. He
laid the child down in the shade of it, he
looked to see there were no ants or other
insects near; he put on the bootee that was
hanging by a string from the little rosy foot
and he stuck the india-rubber comforter in its
mouth. Then he walked quietly away and
caught up to Dot.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ she said, but she looked a little
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>startled at his empty arms; she drooped the
sunshade over the shoulder nearest to him,
and gave a hasty, surreptitious glance backward.
Larrie strode along.</p>

<p>‘You look fearfully ugly when you screw
up your mouth like that,’ she said, looking
up at his set side face.</p>

<p>‘You’re an unnatural mother, Dot, that’s
what you are,’ he returned hotly. ‘By Jove,
if I was a woman, I’d be ashamed to act as
you do. You get worse every day you live.
I’ve kept excusing you to myself, and saying
you would get wiser as you grew older, and
instead, you seem more childish every day.’</p>

<p>She looked childish. She was very, very
small in stature, very slightly and delicately
built. Her hair was in soft gold-brown curls,
as short as a boy’s; her eyes were soft, and
wide, and tender, and beautiful as a child’s.
When she was happy they were the colour
of that blue, deep violet we call the Czar, and
when she grew thoughtful, or sorrowful, they
were like the heart of a great, dark purple
pansy. She was not particularly beautiful,
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>only very fresh, and sweet, and lovable.
Larrie once said she always looked like a
baby that has been freshly bathed and
dressed, and puffed with sweet violet powder,
and sent out into the world to refresh tired
eyes.</p>

<p>That was one of his courtship sayings, more
than a year ago when she was barely seventeen.
She was eighteen now, and he was
telling her she was an unnatural mother.</p>

<p>‘Why, the child wouldn’t have had its bib
on, only I saw to it,’ he said, in a voice that
increased in excitement as he dwelt on the
enormity.</p>

<p>‘Dear me,’ said Dot, ‘that was very careless
of Peggie, I must really speak to her about it.’</p>

<p>‘I shall shake you some day, Dot,’ Larrie
said, ‘shake you till your teeth rattle. Sometimes
I can hardly keep my hands off you.’</p>

<p>His brow was gloomy, his boyish face
troubled, vexed.</p>

<p>And Dot laughed. Leaned against the
fence skirting the road that seemed to run to
eternity, and laughed outrageously.</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>7<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Larrie stopped too. His face was very
white and square-looking, his dark eyes held
fire. He put his hands on the white, exaggerated
shoulders of her muslin dress and
turned her round.</p>

<p>‘Go back to the bottom of the hill this
instant, and pick up the child and carry it up
here,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Go and insert your foolish old head in a
receptacle for <i>pommes-de-terre</i>,’ was Dot’s
flippant retort.</p>

<p>Larrie’s hands pressed harder, his chin grew
squarer.</p>

<p>‘I’m in earnest, Dot, deadly earnest. I order
you to fetch the child, and I intend you to
obey me,’ he gave her a little shake to enforce
the command. ‘I am your master, and I
intend you to know it from this day.’</p>

<p>Dot experienced a vague feeling of surprise
at the fire in the eyes that were nearly always
clear, and smiling, and loving, then she twisted
herself away.</p>

<p>‘Pooh,’ she said, ‘you’re only a stupid overgrown,
passionate boy, Larrie. You my
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>master! You’re nothing in the world but
my husband.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going?’ he said in a tone he had
never used before to her. ‘Say Yes or No,
Dot, instantly.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Dot, stormily.</p>

<p>Then they both gave a sob of terror, their
faces blanched, and they began to run madly
down the hill.</p>

<p>Oh the long, long way they had come, the
endless stretch of red, red road that wound
back to the gold-tipped wattles, the velvet
grass, and their baby!</p>

<p>Larrie was a fleet, wonderful runner. In
the little cottage where they lived, manifold
silver cups and mugs bore witness to it, and
he was running for life now, but Dot nearly
outstripped him.</p>

<p>She flew over the ground, hardly touching
it, her arms were outstretched, her lips
moving. They fell down together on their
knees by their baby, just as three furious,
hard-driven bullocks thundered by, filling the
air with dust and bellowing.</p>

<p><a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>9<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The baby was blinking happily up at a
great fat golden beetle that was making a
lazy way up the wattle. It had lost its ‘comforter’
and was sucking its thumb thoughtfully.
It had kicked off its white knitted
boots, and was curling its pink toes up in the
sunshine with great enjoyment.</p>

<p>‘Baby!’ Larrie said. The big fellow was
trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>‘<em>Baby!</em>’ said Dot. She gathered it up in
her little shaking arms, she put her poor
white face down upon it, and broke into such
pitiful tears and sobs that it wept too. Larrie
took them both into his arms, and sat down
on a fallen tree. He soothed them, he called
them a thousand tender, beautiful names; he
took off Dot’s hat and stroked her little curls, he
kissed his baby again and again; he kissed his
wife. When they were all quite calm and the
bullocks ten miles away, they started again.</p>

<p>‘I’ll carry him,’ said Larrie.</p>

<p>‘Ah no, let me,’ Dot said.</p>

<p>‘Darling, you’re too tired—see, you can
hold his hand across my shoulder.’</p>

without him.’</p>

<p>‘But the hill—my big baby!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I <em>must</em> have him—Larrie, <em>let</em> me—see,
he is so light—why, he is nothing to carry.’</p>

 /><small>THE RED ROAD COUNTRY</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> cool weather the Red Road was very
pleasant walking. It wound up hill and down
dale for many a mile till it reached Hornsby,
and branched away into different country.</p>

<p>All the way there were gum trees—gum
trees and fences; here and there were closer
palings and garden shrubs indicating human
residence, but they were far apart and the
road was very lonely. Parallel to it and showing
in places between the trees was the single
line of the railway. It did not spoil the
scenery at all, it rather gave a friendly look
to it and reminded the pedestrian that in
spite of the bush silences, the towering trees,
the vista of blue hills and the mountain-like
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>freshness of the air, he could be in all the
bustle and happy fellowship of town in half-an-hour.</p>

<p>Away to the left the ground dipped, then
rose again, in a blue soft hill, dipped again,
and the new rise was purple and beautiful.
The third dip, just a line, white sometimes
and again blue was the harbour. On clear
days one could see the smoke of vessels.
Beyond the hills and the water-line stretched
Sydney city, white and shining in the distant
sunlight. Further away, over near the sky,
the grey blue hills and the light that meant
sand-stretches was Botany.</p>

<p>Higher up, and between the first and second
hill-rise, ran the river they call Lane Cove.
A great white building, St Ignatius, made
one land-mark and the Mortlake gas-works
another; from those places the residents
knew their geography. That was Eastwood
away over there, nestling among hills; those
blurred cottages indicated Ryde; just where
the tree tops showed in a hollow, was the
head of the river, and right away on the west
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>horizon a certain patch was the highest place
in the blue mountains. In a few years the
beautiful country-side will be commonplace
suburbs; there will be stucco villas and
terrace houses, shops and paved roads; the
railway has broken its fastness and the change
is inevitable.</p>

<p>The smooth grass slopes, the wooded
stretches will live only in memory. The
great red-and-black and silver-limbed gums
will be hewn down to make way for spreading
civilisation. The blue gracious hills will be
thick with chimneys and advertisement boards.
There will be a double line of railway, no
longer picturesque, and big spreading stations
instead of primitive sidings where one held up
a ‘flag by day and a light at night’ to be
picked up of the passing train.</p>

<p>Past St Leonard’s the railway is very new,
a matter of months indeed.</p>

<p>Before it was opened there were obstacles in
the way of reaching Sydney that made would-be
residents shake their heads, and go to live
at Paddington, and Forest Lodge, and such
<a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>crowded places that could be reached by tram
with a certain degree of comfort.</p>

<p>But before the year of grace 1893, the
train from the hills that only just escaped
being mountains, used to empty out its
passengers on the little St Leonard’s Station.
There were two ways only after that of
getting to Sydney.</p>

<p>Either one merrily trudged a pathway
mile, and then caught a North Shore cable
tram to the point where the Ferry boat
leaves for the Circular Quay, or one entrusted
one’s life and well-being to a vehicle that
might have been a Noah’s Ark, or a bathing
machine, or a convict van.</p>

<p>In ancient days it used to run between
Shoalhaven and Moss-Vale, as its red painted
sides still bore witness, but travellers in those
parts did better for themselves, so they
brought it here, and charged sixpence each
way for the twenty-five minutes’ journey.
Now there is a combination of the railway;
pressure was brought to bear, and the New
South Wales Government finished in a hurry
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a work that had dragged on till people
despaired of its completion. The line winds
down towards the chimneys and smoke of
‘The Shore’; one has glimpses from the
train of blue bright bays and white sails
moored boats, and a broken wharf or two
waiting to catch the artist’s eye. Then it
skirts along the harbour, close to the water,
in a semi-circular sweep, and makes an eye-sore.
Two years ago, Lavender Bay was
beautiful.</p>

<p>But about the Red Road. Just at the top
of one of the elevations, there was a big stone
house standing in the middle of an orange
and lemon orchard. Dot’s mother lived here
by herself.</p>

<p>A mile and a half away down the road
there was a weather-board cottage in a garden
running over with flowers. Larrie and Dot
lived here, and the baby of course. They had
been going up to ‘mother’s’ the afternoon
they quarrelled about carrying the child;
they always went on Sundays.</p>

<p>Very often Dot went on Mondays too,
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that was the day Peggie, her <i>aide-de-camp</i>,
made the cottage unsavoury with soap-suds.
Tuesday nights they always had dinner up at
the house, Peggie never had time to cook on
Tuesdays, there were so many of Dot’s
dresses and Larrie’s shirts, and baby’s multitudinous
garments to be finely ironed.</p>

<p>On Thursdays and Saturdays the mother
used to come down to the cottage and put it
straight, and help poor Peggie, and bring a
new knitted jacket or bootees or a hood or
pinafore for baby.</p>

<p>The house was a big lonely place for such a
little woman. She was even smaller than Dot.
She had a tiny fragile figure, and a tiny face,
brown and shrivelled with Australian suns.
Her eyes were very big and pathetic, something
like Dot’s in wistful moments, and her
mouth with its infinitude of lines, was very
sweet.</p>

<p>After her eyes, her brooch was the first
thing that invited notice. It was one of
those large, very old-fashioned ones with a
miniature set on the front of it. Dot had
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>begged her to cease wearing it; ‘It isn’t good
taste,’ she had said once vexedly, ‘keep it in
a drawer;’ but the mother would not lay it
aside even though it was the only thing in
which she had ever thwarted Dot in her
life.</p>

<p>When she went to bed she pinned it on
her night-gown, when she dressed in the
morning she fastened her collar with it. A
hundred times a day her fingers strayed to it.
In her sleep her hand stole up and closed
upon it.</p>

<p>The miniature was of a very young man in
the old fashioned naval uniform that used to
be worn forty years ago. He had the correct
miniature smile, but the eyes were well done
and you could see his brow had been splendid.
He was Dot’s father, dead sixteen years ago;
it was the only likeness he had ever had
taken.</p>

<p>Inside the brooch was a cluster of little
heads, gaudily painted, six in all; Dot, the
seventh, had been born after it was
done.</p>

<p><a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>18<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Four of the heads pressed clay pillows in a
churchyard not very far away, seas washed
over the fifth, and the sixth lay in a lonely
grave in the wilds of Western Australia.</p>

<p>Dot was the only one alive, and now she
had flown from the home-nest to one of her
own, leaving unutterable desolation behind
her in the mother’s heart.</p>

<p>It was because death had so broken and
bruised this little frail mother that she had
never crossed Dot’s will in anything since she
was born. The days of insistence and control,
and obedience-seeking were buried with the
buried six. Dot ruled, and the mother poured
out her heart at her feet and worshipped
with a love almost desperate.</p>

<p>So when Dot said she was going to be
married at once, albeit only seventeen years
had passed over her little sunny head, the
mother had not been able to refuse. She
had only reminded Larrie, whom she loved
dearly and had known for years, how young
her darling was, and on her knees she had
prayed him to be good to her always. Larrie
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was twenty-two. For sixteen years he had
come up to the house in the holidays at the
first sign of a ripening orange; he had eaten
bananas with Dot, one of them at each end of
the fruit, when she was two.</p>

<p>He had played cricket with her at six,
climbed trees with her at ten, pulled her hair
and pinched her for being a girl at twelve,
forgotten her for a time at fifteen, and come
back and married her at seventeen.</p>

<p>He had £250 a year, and no guardians
or parents to give him unasked advice. So
he resolved to take a year’s holiday according
to his doctor’s orders, before he started his
profession, and teach and train Dot till she
was an ideal wife. He had all kinds of ideas
on the subject, though he was so very boyish
to look at, and he intended to inculcate Dot
with them all. But for the first year he was
so exuberantly happy he forgot all about
them.</p>

<p>It was only when the baby was growing
into months, and Dot was continually forgetting
some article of its clothing, or the kicking
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>exercise that was to make it an athlete, or
when her piano made her forget its existence
for a little while, that he began to think he
was not doing his duty by her, and must turn
over a new leaf.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> cottage was a delightful place. It was
built of weatherboard, not the kind that overlaps,
but that with a groove between each
board. The verandah was very wide and ran
round the four sides; that was Larrie’s great
extravagance when he improved the place.</p>

<p>‘Where’s a fellow to smoke when it’s hot
or wet if there isn’t a decent verandah?’ he
said.</p>

<p>He and Dot had walked miles upon it in
the early months of the year, he with his pipe
in his lips and a look of great content in his
eyes, she with her hands linked at the back
of her neck or slipped around his arm.</p>

<p><a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>22<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>There was a profusion of hammocks and
lounges and chairs that made you lazy to look
at them. That was Dot’s extravagance. On
one side the outer wall was of yellow and
white roses that flowered eternally, on another,
wistaria with delicate down-dropping blooms.
The third—the kitchen side—was passion-vines,
and the fourth was clear, and showed a
grand sweep of country, and all the Sydney
vista.</p>

<p>There was a narrow hall and a painted
front door, on either side of it long French
windows opening, one into the dining-room,
the other into Dot’s beautiful little drawing-room.</p>

<p>She had spent a week thinking out the
furnishing of that room, and nearly all her
mother’s wedding-present cheque upon it.</p>

<p>‘No, I won’t have a carpet,’ she said when
her mother was dwelling upon the advantages
of Brussels over Wilton pile, ‘and no, I won’t
have felt, it’s too stuffy looking; and if you
buy me a proper tapestry suite I shall set
fire to it. In India people furnish sensibly,
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but in Australia, which must be nearly as hot,
they do everything in English style.’</p>

<p>The little mother ceased her suggestions,
and Dot worked her own will with really
charming effect.</p>

<p>The room was rather low, and the walls and
ceiling tinted a delicate green. There was a
large centre square of white matting, fringed
at the edge and a border of pale green around
it. The three French windows had long soft
curtains of white with pale green frills. No
two chairs were alike. They were of rattan
and pith, and bamboo in quaint shapes. One
had a flat sea-green cushion of plush, one a
triangular one of silk with frills of coral pink;
there was a lovely pith sofa lounge, wide,
inviting, with a pile of pillows in cool Liberty
silk. In a corner the piano stood, a beautiful
instrument though very plain. It was not
draped in art muslin, and it had no photos or
<i>bric-à-brac</i> on it to jingle and spoil the wonderful
music Dot brought forth from it. A great
lamp stood beside it with a green crinkled
paper canopy, restful to the eye.</p>

<p><a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>24<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>In another corner there was a low bookcase
running along the wall; volumes of Browning
caught the eye, Tennyson, William Morris,
Shelley, Keats, all the gods.</p>

<p>There was a sandal wood writing-table,
with silver handles and silver equipments, a
silver lamp with a rose-leaf shade, and a
photo of baby in a silver chased frame.</p>

<p>There was not a tambourine on the walls,
not a single fan pocket, not a plaque. Half-a-dozen
pictures perhaps, bits of exquisite
colouring chiefly in long narrow gold frames;
a sunset at Manly Lagoon, a bit of the
Kanimbla valley, with summer upon it, a
water colour of the road above Mossman’s
Bay, a woman’s face, pale and unspeakably
beautiful, painted against a background of
purple velvet, some chrysanthemums, tawny
yellow and brown.</p>

<p>One or two engravings as well. ‘Wedded’
in an oak frame hung over the piano. Dot
said the man was Larrie’s very counterpart;
when she sang she used to look up at it and
feel glad he was her husband. On a tall
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>easel on a table there was the ‘Peacemaker.’
Larrie said the little girl was Dot. There
were bits of quaint china on the little tables,
and a few photographs, not many. Flowers
there were in all possible places. Daffodils
and spiky leaves in the windows, roses and
‘shivery’ grass on the tables, low vases of
violets and primroses, tall ones of jonquils.
Dot dusted this room herself every morning,
then before she could put the duster away,
the piano would tempt her, and the rest of
the house be forgotten. But for Peggie what
a place it would have been!</p>

<p>Peggie was a real Cornstalk. She was fully
five-feet-eleven, and had impossibly long arms
and an impossible number of freckles. But
she had also all a Cornstalk’s warm, honest
heart; she was devoted to Dot and Larrie, and
absolutely worshipped the baby. She made
no better a servant as far as work went, than
the average untrained Australian girl; but
she was wonderfully learned in the ways and
wants of babyhood, and so was invaluable to
Dot who was absurdly ignorant.  When
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Larrie had engaged her twelve months ago
at a Sydney registry office, he had asked her
name.</p>

<p>‘Marjorie<!-- TN: original reads "Majorie" --> Dorothy Pegerton,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Larrie, ‘that’s a high day and
holiday name, shall we say Mary on week
days?’</p>

<p>‘Marjie, some folks call me,’ she answered.
‘Or there’s Dolly—I’m not particular—you
can even call me Peg if you like, Mr—what was it the gentleman said your name
was?’</p>

<p>‘Armitage,’ said Larrie, ‘and let us decide
on Peggie; it is unique, and altogether
charming in these days.’</p>

<p>They were both very fond of Peggie, she
was the stay of the cottage in all domestic
affairs—it would have fallen to pieces but
for her, and the baby—well there is
really no knowing what would have happened
to that same baby had it not been
for Peggie.</p>

<p>Larrie generally minded the baby on
Thursday mornings. It was Thursday morning
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>now. Peggie was doing her routine work
for that time, scrubbing the bare pine floors
of the bedrooms. Larrie and Dot both hated
carpets.</p>

<p>Larrie was smoking his third postprandial
pipe, and was pacing up and down one side of
the verandah; he would have liked to have
gone the whole distance, but then there was
the baby.</p>

<p>It was lying in a hammock in a nest of
pillows, and looking with calm, large gaze out
into all the world that appeared through a
gap in the rose creeper. There was the
pink flush of recent sleep on its little soft
cheeks, and its hair, the softest, warmest gold
in the world, was all tumbled and curly with
washing. It had a wonderful amount of hair
for so young a child, and Dot’s pride in it
was forgivable, for nearly all the babies of
her acquaintance were bald.</p>

<p>Have you ever kissed a baby’s neck?
Was ever anything so warm and white and
velvety? The neck of Dot’s baby was absolutely
beyond description.  Its mouth was
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>red, bowshaped. Sometimes it gave wide
wet touches on Dot’s cheeks, and she would
whisper excitedly to Larrie that it was kissing
her.</p>

<p>Such wonderful, wondering eyes it had,
intensely blue, intensely earnest. There had
been moments when Larrie felt he would
give his soul to know just what his baby was
thinking of.</p>

<p>Did you show it a beautiful flower or a low
hanging silver moon, a picture, something
bright with colour? it seemed to be looking
away far beyond them and smiling in a faint
sweet way, because it saw fairer things than
ever you dreamed of.</p>

<p>Its hands—well, perhaps they were like
most babies’ hands, but neither Dot, nor
Larrie, nor Peggie, nor the little mother would
have allowed it for a moment. They were
like the inside of a flushed, curled, rose-leaf,
and when they closed round your finger, you
felt how strangely sweet, and soft and warm
they were. From the long open window
came the sound of Dot’s voice, singing. The
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>baby was listening as it lay in the hammock.
Larrie was listening as he smoked, though in
a half reluctant way.</p>

<p>When little souls are born, just before they
come to us from the wonderful place of souls,
they have to do with a lottery. To a
thousand little blind struggling souls, there
are half-a-dozen great good gifts. Nine
hundred and ninety-four draw blanks, but
the band of six come down to us blessed,
rejoicing. Dot had been of the six. She
had drawn a voice. Generally Larrie rejoiced
because of it.</p>

<p>Not this morning, however. He had been
brooding lately over Dot’s deficiencies<!-- TN: original reads "deficencies" -->, and he
almost wished she had been of the nine
hundred and ninety-four. For one thing,
he could have walked all the four sides of
the verandah if she had been. The thought
rankled.</p>

<p>‘Dot,’ he called in ‘a voice.’</p>

<p>Only little bursts of melody answered him.
She was singing a rippling song of Schubert’s;
it was in keeping with the warm, soft air
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>outside, the twittering of birds, the faint
motion of the gum leaves.</p>

<p>‘Dot!’ he shouted.</p>

<p>She put a curly little head between the
window curtains.</p>

<p>‘Well, Larrakin?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Come and mind the baby,’ he said shortly,
‘I want to smoke.’</p>

<p>‘But baby doesn’t mind smoke at all—do
you, small sweet?’ she said, going over to
the hammock. ‘Oh Larrie, look how uncomfortable
he is, you’re a nice one to look
after him; and where’s his comforter? he’ll
have no thumb left presently.’</p>

<p>‘I threw it away,’ Larrie answered, ‘all that
indiarubber can’t be good for him, I don’t
intend him to have another.’</p>

<p>‘Stupid!’ said Dot. She kissed the baby,
tickled it, tossed it, then laid it down
again.</p>

<p>‘What did you call me for,’ she said. ‘I
was just enjoying myself.’ Her eyes still had
the look of being away in the spheres. ‘He’s
all right there and it’s your turn to mind him,
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Larrie. I walked him about for an hour in
the night.’</p>

<p>She moved to go in again.</p>

<p>‘Stop here when I tell you, and mind him,’
he said in an unpardonable voice.</p>

<p>Dot gave him a surprised look.</p>

<p>‘You forget yourself, Larrie,’ she said quietly.</p>

<p>She went in and her fingers wandered into
the quiet, calm music of one of Mendelssohn’s
gondola songs. But she took it in rather
hurried time. Larrie disturbed her when he
had this mood on. He came behind her and
lifted her hands off the keyboard.</p>

<p>‘Go and mind the child this minute.’ The
flame in his eyes showed itself instantly in hers.</p>

<p>‘How dare you speak to me like that!’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘Go and mind the child,’ said Larrie.</p>

<p>Dot crashed a passionate chord on the
piano, she lifted her right hand for a brilliant
run. But Larrie picked her up in his arms
and put her outside on the verandah near the
hammock. Then he went in and closed the
drawing-room door behind him.</p>

the dining-room he was locking the piano.</p>

<p>‘How <em>dare</em> you!’ Dot said in trembling
fury. ‘My piano! give me that key
instantly.’</p>

<p>‘Go and mind your child,’ he said. He was
stooping a little, for the key stuck, since it
was never used; his head was almost on a
level with the lid.</p>

<p>The next minute he was standing straight
in confused astoundment. Dot had dealt him
a passionate box on the ear, and fled from the
room.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was unwritten law that thunder storms at
the cottage should never travel to the house.
But when Dot hurried up the drive and
burst into the dining-room with a scarlet face
and glowing eyes, the mother was afraid
something was wrong.</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s Thursday, Dot!’ she said, ‘I
was just coming down.’</p>

<p>Dot took off her wide brimmed hat and
fanned herself for a moment.</p>

<p>‘There was curry cooking in the kitchen,’
she said; ‘onions, pah!’</p>

<p>‘How’s the baby, why didn’t you bring
him?’ asked the little mother.</p>

<p><a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>34<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘Oh, bother the baby,’ said Dot.</p>

<p>‘Is Larrie’s neuralgia better?’ the mother
ventured after a little pause. And ‘bother
Larrie,’ was Dot’s wifely response.</p>

<p>The mother got out the twenty-seventh
pair of boots she was knitting for baby, and
worked two rows in silence. She wondered
if it was Larrie’s fault or Dot’s. Larrie’s she
was sure. She wished Dot was her one little
girl again, so she could take all the troubles
for her.</p>

<p>‘How did Peggie like the new soap I left
her?’ she said, anxiously flying from topics
that made Dot’s brows frown.</p>

<p>‘Bother Peggie,’ said Dot. ‘She washed
baby’s nightgowns with it, and the whole
world’s placarded with advertisements that
say don’t. Idiot!’</p>

<p>‘The oranges are ripening beautifully,’ said
the poor little mother.</p>

<p>Dot went over to her and kissed her
passionately.</p>

<p>‘You’re the best woman in the world,’ she
said.</p>

<p><a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>35<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Tears of quick pleasure sprang into the
mother’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘<em>My</em> little girl,’ she said softly.</p>

<p>She held Dot from her a minute, and
scanned the flushed face with eyes that saw
everything.</p>

<p>‘I wish I was,’ Dot said, in a stifled tone,
‘<!-- TN: opening quote invisible in original -->just yours.’</p>

<p>Anger crept into the mother’s big eyes.
‘Has Larrie?’—she said, ‘Larrie, has he—does
he?’—indignation overcame her.</p>

<p>‘Oh no,’ said Dot, ashamed of so nearly infringing
the law. ‘Larrie’s all right—what are
you running your head against, small woman?’</p>

<p>‘He is good to you?’ suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘<em>Very</em> good.’</p>

<p>She got up and went to the piano. ‘I
came to have a good practice,’ she said. ‘One
can’t with baby about.’</p>

<p>She screwed up the stool, opened the lid,
and got out a pile of music. Wagner was
at the bottom of the canterbury, and she
sought for him, and then attacked him with
level brows.</p>

<p><a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>36<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>By the time she had made ten mistakes,
and the little mother’s head was aching, there
was the click of an opening gate.</p>

<p>‘I—’ said Dot,
‘<!-- TN: opening quote placed before second "I" in original -->I—think I shall go home.’
She jumped up and peeped through the
Venetian. ‘Baby may want me, and—and—if
Larrie should happen to come in, you
needn’t say I’ve been; he thinks I walk too
much.’</p>

<p>She gave her mother a hurried kiss on the
top of her cap, and slipped out of the back
door and across the paddocks to the train.</p>

<p>Larrie came down the hall with slow step.
He sat down in Dot’s old rocking-chair.
‘Morning, mum,’ he said, ‘the oranges are
looking lovely.’ He was eating one he had
plucked near the gate, but did not seem to
be paying any attention to the taste of it.<!-- TN: period invisible in original --></p>

<p>The little mother regarded him with eyes
full of severity, though she tried to hide it.</p>

<p>‘Dot is not looking well,’ she said, ‘haven’t
you noticed? We mustn’t let her do too
much, we must be very careful of her, Larrie
boy.’</p>

<p><a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>37<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Larrie looked a trifle disturbed for a minute,
then righteous wrath prevailed over incipient
anxiety. ‘Why she doesn’t do anything,’<!-- TN: closing quote invisible in original -->
he said, ‘<em>anything</em>.’</p>

<p>‘She’s very young,’ was the mother’s reply.</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s nothing,’ said Larrie ‘lots
of girls of eighteen are married and do
everything.’</p>

<p>‘Not little tiny girls like Dot,’ urged
mother, ‘you mustn’t be hard on her, Larrie,
she’ll be all she should be in time.’</p>

<p>‘But not if I don’t teach her,’ he insisted;
‘why, how can she?’</p>

<p>‘It comes of itself,’ the mother answered.</p>

<p>But a dark look of recollective annoyance
spread over Larrie’s brow.</p>

<p>‘She forgot baby’s teething necklace three
days last week, she’s always forgetting things,’
he said.</p>

<p>Then he too remembered the law, and ate
the rest of his orange in silence.</p>

<p>‘I wish you would not come down to the
cottage quite so often,’ was the remark with
which he broke a meditation that had
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>involved criss-crossed brows and five slow
minutes. A little odd sound broke from
the mother’s lips. Larrie looked up and saw
she was white under her brown and her eyes
were piteous.</p>

<p>He crossed over to her with two swift steps.
He knelt down beside her chair, and put both
his arms round her thin waist.</p>

<p>‘How dare you, mum, how <em>dare</em> you have
such thoughts!’ he said. He kissed her
several times in an eager, boyish way. ‘You
<em>know</em> you could never come too often for me,
you <em>know</em> you are more to me than my own
mother ever was. It’s only Dot, don’t you
see? She’s getting too dependent, mum.
We’ll have to let her stand alone a little
more. Peggie spoils her, you spoil her—I
even spoil her myself—mightn’t it be a good
thing to let her do things by herself for a
change, just for a trial, mum? And she
shall come here of course. Only, don’t you
come to the cottage for a bit, and do all the
things she leaves undone in that quiet little
way you have.’</p>

<p><a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>39<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘Not even Saturdays, Larrie? That’s the
hardest day.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ Larrie said. ‘Be a good little mum
and leave her to me.’</p>

<p>He stood up, all his six feet and odd inches,
his young face grave, resolute, his eyes full of
seriousness.</p>

<p>‘He looks like a man fit to be trusted with
his own wife,’ the little mother told herself as
she looked up at him.</p>

<p>Aloud, she said in a tone of wistful resignation.
‘Very well, Larrie, you will be gentle
with her, I know—she’s such a little thing.’</p>

<p>Larrie walked home. He was thinking
all the way of the new leaf he was about
to turn. Dot had behaved in an altogether
unforgivable manner. He must be
firm with her, very firm, he told himself.
He was inclined to spoil her, as he had said,
and overlook her faults—but from now, he
must show her, too, his displeasure at the
disrespectful way she had treated him in the
morning. Boxing a husband’s ears!</p>

<p>The red burnt on his brow as he opened
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the gate, thinking of it and heard Dot
trilling Amiens’ song as she watered some
sickly pelargoniums she was trying to grow.</p>

<p>‘I must be firm, very firm,’ Dot had told
herself. ‘No husband should order his wife
about in the way Larrie ordered me. He is a
little, just a little inclined to tyrannise, and I
shall be laying up unhappiness for myself if I
do not nip it in the earliest bud.’</p>

<p class="pgbrk">When she saw his figure coming down the
hill, she laid the baby down in the cot inside
and bade Peggie give an eye to him. Then
she popped on a clean muslin dress with
forget-me-nots sprinkled all over it, tied the
blue ribbons of her picturesque garden hat in
a coquettish bow at the side of her chin, and
when Larrie opened the gate she was flitting
about the flower beds with an absurdly small
red watering can in her hand and the gay
little song on her lips. It certainly was provoking.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and a whole gamut of lilts and trills of her
own introduction.</p>

<p>Larrie closed his lips very tightly and strode
past her into the house.</p>

<p>‘I might have known she would turn into
that kind of woman,’ he muttered, casting off
his straw hat in the dining-room. ‘A man
never knows a girl till he’s married to her,
she never shows herself in a true light before.’</p>

<p>He went into an adjoining bedroom for a
linen coat to get cool in.</p>

<p>Baby was disporting himself in the high-sided
cot; his little legs were bare and kicking
against the pillows, his arms were bare,
and his soft, sweet neck. Such a gurgle and
chirrup of welcome he gave his father! He
banged his heels on the iron, he gave a
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rapturous little leap, and said ‘Googul,
googul, googul.’</p>

<p>Larrie glanced half-shamefacedly through
the window to make sure Dot could not see,
and then he went over to the cot and said
glad responsive ‘googuls,’ and submitted his
crisp curls to the wee fingers, and tossed him
about in his arms.</p>

<p>But when the dinner-bell rang he laid him
down in a hurry, and moved out of the room.
Only he could not quite call up the stern
‘firm’ manner again.</p>

<p>Dot sprang up the verandah steps, and went
into the bedroom to take off her hat, and
wash invisible gardening marks from her
fingers.</p>

<p>‘I won’t quarrel,’ she whispered to herself,
‘but I must really show him I am not to be
bullied. I will be <em>very</em> firm.’</p>

<p>‘Googul’ said baby.</p>

<p>Such a mournful little googul! there were
actually two tiny tears welling up in the blue
wide eyes, for tossing and petting were joyful
to him.</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>43<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Dot shut the door. Then she said ‘<em>Baby</em>’
in a tempestuous little way, and two quick
answering tears sprang up in her own eyes as
she lifted him up to her. It was such a lonely,
reproachful little ‘googul.’ She sat down on
the bed with him, and made his small
heart gladsome again with kisses and baby-talk.</p>

<p>The door opened one inch—then wide.</p>

<p>‘The curry coolin’ as ’ard as it can, and
master lookin’ black, and ’ere you are,’ said
Peggie resentfully. ‘Give ’im to me, the
darling angel.’</p>

<p>Dot handed him over, and hurried into the
dining-room.</p>

<p>‘You’re putting milk in, what are you
thinking of?’ Larrie said in an injured tone
after two minutes’ silence. Dot was actually
thus spoiling the cup of tea he always drank
brown and sugarful. Peggie had forgotten
the slop basin. Dot got up to go to the
cupboard which was near Larrie’s end of the
table.</p>

<p>‘If you’ll never be naughty again I’ll

Her eyes were wet, sorry, pleading.</p>

<p>‘You <em>dear</em> little girl,’ Larrie said. He laid
down his knife and fork and put his arms
round her waist, ‘I was a perfect brute to
you, it was all my fault.’</p>

<p>‘No, mine,’ said Dot.<!-- TN: original shows superfluous closing quote --></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">But</span> naturally this kind of thing could not go
on for ever.</p>

<p>Quarrels, with little tender makings up like
that had a certain charm while their freshness
lasted. But when the fallings out became
events of almost weekly occurrence, the fallings
in were no longer things to be put away
in ‘the hushed herbarium where we keep our
hearts’ forget-me-nots.’</p>

<p>Larrie <em>was</em> exacting and inclined to be
tyrannical. And Dot <em>was</em> careless and childish,
and unreasonable. The first week that the
mother did not come down to look after
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Peggie, and do her fifty odd acts of straightening,
the cottage was in a glorious state of
muddle.</p>

<p>Larrie by nature was an order-loving and
somewhat methodical man, and had an inborn
objection to see Dot’s pretty slippers lying
about the house, or stray articles of baby’s
clothing on the verandah chairs. He thought
breakfast things too ought not to be left on
the table till all hours in the morning, and
when Dot asked him how he could expect
Peggie to dress baby and make the beds <em>and</em>
wash up by ten, he retorted brutally that she
was a lazy little slattern, and should do it
herself.</p>

<p>‘A slattern is a person untidy in herself,’
Dot replied, ‘you can’t say you’ve ever seen
me like that, Laurence Armitage!’</p>

<p>And he certainly could not. Whatever
her faults were, Dot was a little lady to the
backbone, and would have been always sweet
and fresh, and guiltless of pins and rents if she
had never been able to afford more than
fourpence half-penny prints to clothe herself
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with. Shabby finery she had a wholesome
detestation for; however plain her dress might
be, it was always dainty, her shoes fitted trimly,
her collar was above reproach and fastened
with precision, her gloves were unsoiled, and
her hats always fresh if only trimmed with
Indian muslin.</p>

<p>But she was certainly a shocking young
person where household matters were concerned.
There was plenty of work to do
even in so small a place; Peggie, however,
had cheerfully taken it on her own shoulders
at the beginning, and the things she ought to
have done and left undone, the little mother
did.</p>

<p>It was not until there was a third member
in the family that the housework was appreciably
neglected. When the fascination of
‘dressing baby’ was no longer new to Dot,
and Peggie, its devoted worshipper, begged to
add that duty to her others, Dot consented
with alacrity. And Larrie looked on and
told himself daily these things ought not to
be.</p>

<p><a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>48<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>One day there was a very great passage-at-arms.
Peggie had gone to Sydney for the
day to spend her month’s wages in a fearful
and wonderful hat she had long had her eye
upon, and Dot was left with the whole
burden of the household upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>Generally on the rare occasions of Peggie’s
absence, the mother came down and presided
over the kitchen and the baby, and Dot had
little else to do than lay the table and help
to dish up. But to-day Larrie’s wicked conspiracy
stood in the way.</p>

<p>The mother sent down a little note; it was
very hot, would Dot mind if she did not come,
her head was inclined to ache badly? And
Larrie had ‘business in town’ and would be
back by the train just in time for dinner.</p>

<p>Dot felt overwhelmed with the responsibilities
of her position.</p>

<p>‘I think you had better take baby up to
mother’s first, Larrie,’ she said, ‘I don’t see
how I am to mind him and cook the dinner
and do everything.’</p>

<p>‘How does Peggie manage when you’re
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>away? My dear Dot, I hope you are not
going to give me the idea that you are one
of those women utterly without resource,’
said my lord Larrie. ‘My sister <span class="nw">Charlotte—</span>’</p>

<p>‘Grace!’ cried Dot, ‘spare me the recapitulation
of the puddings she could make
and the wonders she could do at sixteen.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I only wanted to show you,’ said
Larrie.</p>

<p>He brushed the dust off his shoulders, set
his straw hat perfectly straight on his head—he
always wore it tilted forward or stuck
jauntily back in these wilds—and with a
paternal kind of kiss to Dot and a grandfatherly
one to the baby, he departed.</p>

<p>‘I’ll just show him what I can do,’ said
Dot going kitchenwards. ‘Horrid boy!’</p>

<p>It was six or thereabouts when the ‘horrid
boy’ returned. He was hungry—amazingly
hungry—and apart from his experiment he
really hoped that there was a very nice
dinner ready. The white tablecloth was on
the dining-room table and the flowers were
exquisitely arranged, drooping blossoms of
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wistaria and delicate leaves on a ground of
pale yellow silk. There were also some
knives and forks in a heap, two salt-cellars
and the silver gong. From the bedroom
came doleful baby wails that filled all the
cottage. From the kitchen a strong smell
of burning.</p>

<p>‘Gracious Lor,’ said Peggie.</p>

<p>But ‘Hang it all!’ was her master’s
remark.</p>

<p>Peggie set her bandbox down and followed
at his heels into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Dot was standing over the fire. Nearly
every piece of crockery in the house stood
dirty upon the table. Egg shells lay about,
the sugar jar, the currant, the peel, the
pepper, the flour, and all the store cupboard
were in evidence. She turned a peony face
towards them. ‘Dinner’s not ready yet, and
it’s no use being cross, Larrie, if only you
knew what a bother I’ve had with the fire.’
She lifted a saucepan with a groan and set it
aside.</p>

<p>‘Is there <em>anything</em> to eat?’ Larrie asked in
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a tone not altogether mild. ‘The place
smells like a crematorium.’</p>

<p>Dot sniffed. ‘Does it?’ she said. ‘The
meat’s burnt, I couldn’t help it, it burnt
while I ran in to dress baby, and then a
visitor came after I put some cakes and a
batter pudding in the oven, and they burnt,
there’s a boiled pudding though, it’ll be
cooked in half-an-hour, and we can have eggs
for once.’<!-- TN: original lacks closing quote --></p>

<p>Peggie hastened to her bedroom to change
her very best dress for an old one in which
she might take command of her region.</p>

<p>‘You really mean to say, Dot, that in all
these hours you haven’t been able to cook a
little dinner,’ Larrie began. His chin squared
itself, his lips closed.</p>

<p>‘It’s no good making faces, my good man,’
Dot said. ‘I’ve cut my thumb, and I’ve
burnt my wrist, and had sparks in my eyes,
and now this is all the thanks I get.’<!-- TN: original lacks closing quote --></p>

think I’ve not had enough without <em>you</em>
beginning?’</p>

<p>‘—The table not set and a crying baby,’
Larrie went on.</p>

<p>‘Larrie, <em>do</em> you want to provoke me into
throwing a saucepan at your head like an
Irish washerwoman?’ Dot said.</p>

<p>She took the lid off the potatoes and disclosed
a pulpy mass boiled out of all recognition.</p>

<p>‘I don’t profess to be perfect; accidents
will happen even to the sister Charlottes.’</p>

<p>‘It’s this kind of thing that drives a man
from his home to seek comfort and pleasure
elsewhere,’ Larrie said darkly. He really
felt exceedingly ill-used, and Dot’s heated
face and worried expression did not appeal to
him at all.</p>

<p>He even steeled his heart to the little tired
tremble in her voice that showed the tears
were near, and all the time came the distracting
sound of baby’s mournful screams that no
one had time or inclination to soothe.</p>

<p><a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>53<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘You’re a bad wife, Dot,’ Larrie said, fully
persuaded she was.</p>

<p>Dot gave a hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>‘All this because your food’s not ready to
put in your mouth; men are as bad as animals
in the Zoo when meal time is delayed!’</p>

<p>‘You fail in your duty in every respect,
look at this kitchen, Dot, think of the dinner,
listen to your child.’</p>

<p>But Dot, utterly tired and overwrought,
burst into a passion of tears and brushed past
him.</p>

<p>‘I h-h-hate you,’ she said, ‘I <em>wish</em> I wasn’t
married to you, oh I <em>do</em> wish I wasn’t.’</p>

<p>‘And so do I,’ returned Larrie grimly.
Even dinner did not restore his equanimity,
albeit he made a tolerably hearty one with four
boiled eggs, quantities of bread and butter,
and half a tin of sardines as dessert.</p>

<p>Dot stayed out in the garden and refused
food entirely.</p>

<p>She wept oceans of tired, hot tears and
told herself she was the most miserable
woman on earth. Later, when only her
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eyelashes were wet and the quiet evening wind
had cooled her cheeks and heart, she still
wondered why girls all the world over were
in such a hurry to marry.</p>

<p>She thought wistfully of her careless, unfettered
girlhood that she had cut so short
through her own wilfulness.</p>

<p>‘I might have had eight more years,’ she
whispered to herself, ‘twenty-five is the
proper age to marry, he would have been
older and more patient too, and I should
never have felt like this.’</p>

<p>She put down her head on the old seat
back and sobbed again heartbrokenly for ‘like
this’ meant that love was dying.</p>

<p>Then the wind dried her tears once more,
and she sat staring at a patch of light that fell
from the dining-room lamp out upon the
little lawn: she was wondering drearily how
she should be able to live out all the other
days of her life.</p>

<p>Larrie stepped out on the verandah, she
could see the red of his cigar and the dusky
outlines of his figure.</p>

<p><a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>55<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘Dot,’ he called.</p>

<p>The wind carried his voice over the sleeping
flowers, and the wet grass down to the broken
seat and flung it at her. She slipped out of
her place and stole off towards the piece of
ground that was still unreclaimed bush; she
could not bear his presence yet. But he saw
her white flitting dress and followed.</p>

<p>‘The dew’s as heavy as it can be, you’ll get
another cold,’ he said, ‘come in.’</p>

<p>She shook her head without looking at
him.</p>

<p>‘Come in, and don’t be a silly child,’ he
said.</p>

<p>Again she shook her head and walked on.</p>

<p>But he caught her arm and turned her
gently but firmly round.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to have to carry you,’ he
said.  Then he threw his cigar away and
spoke gravely.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Dot, I’m not going to say anything
more about this afternoon, we’ll let
that go, all I want you to understand is you
must give up being childish, and act in a way
<a name="png.068" id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that befits a married woman. I’m tired of
this.’</p>

<p>Dot did not speak, she hardly heard the
words in fact, only the cold tone they were
spoken in. She wondered vaguely if her love
had been dying for a long time or if to-night
was only the beginning. She hoped she
should not live long, she felt quite glad to
think the doctor had said she had no constitution;
how <em>could</em> she go on living if calm careless
affection was going to take the place of
the wonderful love that had once made a
glory of their every hour. They had both
been incredulous of the existence of such a
place as the dead level of matrimony—was
this it indeed they had already come upon?</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said Larrie, ‘I’m waiting, Dot,
are you going to give it up?’</p>

<p>She gave a little start. ‘What do you
mean?’</p>

<p>‘Give up being so childish, will you try?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ she said dully. That was very
easy to promise, she felt so old, so very much
a woman to-night.</p>

<p><a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>57<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Larrie was only half satisfied with that quiet
‘Yes.’ Where was his little loving eager girl
gone who would have done anything in the
world once had he asked it, done it gladly
and rejoiced at its difficulty, flung her arms
round his neck and asked to be tried still
more?</p>

<p>Only that spiritless ‘Yes,’ was her answer
to-night. He stifled a sigh of bitter disappointment.
This was <em>marriage</em>, he supposed.</p>

<p>‘It’s beginning to rain,’ he said heavily,
‘go in.’</p>

<p>She turned to go,—they had been standing
for the last few minutes near the old broken
seat.</p>

<p>Never yet had they parted after the making
up of a quarrel without a kiss, and he would
not omit it now.</p>

<p>But he stooped his head in almost an
awkward way down to her bent one, and it
was not the kiss of a lover.</p>

<p>She merely submitted a drooped cheek to
his lips, and went slowly up to the house alone.</p>

<div>She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Larrie</span> and Dot had come upon the great
rock that lies near the beginning of the
matrimonial path of all those who marry for
love.</p>

<p>Oh the wonderful capacity they had in
those days for torturing themselves! Larrie
used to brood continually in secret over the
change that had come into their lives; his
manner grew cold and indifferent and he consumed
as much tobacco as a man long years
in the bush, and Dot used to shed hot, angry,
grieving tears in private and devote herself to
<a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the management of the house or the baby in
the time that once she had always devoted to
her husband.</p>

<p>Once in one of the passionate little outbursts
she was subject to, she scoffed at him
for his idleness.</p>

<p>‘No wonder you are so fault-finding,
Larrie,’ she said, ‘staying at home day after
day like an old maid. Other husbands don’t
tie themselves to their wives’ apron-strings as
you do.’</p>

<p>It was a little unjust of her, this pettish
speech, though she had received provocation.</p>

<p>Larrie had had a bad illness, a kind of brain
fever soon after his last law examination, and
really had been ordered to take a long
holiday.</p>

<p>‘You are a man of means,’ the doctor had
said. ‘Travel about, loaf generally for a year
or two, do anything you like, but avoid
regular brain work.’</p>

<p>As a first step to a thorough holiday he had
married Dot, and as his means, divided, would
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not permit of travel, he settled down with an
easy mind to ‘loaf.’</p>

<p>He used to ride, and fish, and shoot, walk,
read, and work in the garden generally, but
there were times when he had fits of superlative
laziness and did absolutely nothing but lie
in the hammocks and smoke, or wander about
after Dot.</p>

<p>At first this state of things had been very
delightful and idyllic, but after eighteen
months Dot found it very trying, and used to
wish sincerely that Larrie went off to business
in the morning like other men and stayed
away till evening. She felt certain he would
appreciate both herself and his home more if
he did so, and, seeing he was apparently quite
well and strong, there seemed no reason for
him not to go.</p>

<p>It was this feeling that had prompted the
cutting speech about being tied to her apron,
a garment by the way which she never wore
on any occasion.</p>

<p>Larrie was bitterly offended.</p>

<p>‘You are tired of me, it has come to that
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>already,’ he said, and there was such a note of
pain in his voice that she had slipped her arm
round his neck in her old impetuous way.</p>

<p>‘It was horrid of me,’ she said, ‘of course
you have a right to stay at home always if
you like. Forgive me, Larrie.’</p>

<p>And he had forgiven her after a time, even
kissed her kindly and told her not to mind.</p>

<p>But the very next day he had taken an
office in town and sent a man to paint
‘Laurence Armitage, Solicitor,’ in white
letters on the door.</p>

<p>All her entreaties now would not keep him
at home a day, he caught the business train
at eight o’clock in the morning and the
evening one home at five.</p>

<p>He was like everyone else’s husband at last,
and the garden of Eden had become merely
a cottage with a piece of ground attached.</p>

<p>But oh, such long, long days they were to
both of them at first.</p>

<p>Larrie, of course, had really nothing to do
for weeks and weeks. He used to sit on his
uncomfortable cane chair, put his long legs on
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the window-sill and smoke and think half the
day. Or he would pin a ‘Back in ten
minutes’ notice on his door and stroll aimlessly
about town or drop into the offices of
other men he knew, and envy them their
busy air of occupation.</p>

<p>Dot had never thought so many hours
went to the day before.</p>

<p>Baby slept a great deal, and just beginning
to teethe, was cross and less companionable
than usual. The household tasks that she
took upon herself now did not last long, and
the little mother did so much sewing for
everyone in the cottage that there was really
nothing left for Dot to do, but put on occasional
buttons and tapes. She resolved to
let her voice fill up the blank in her life, it
was her one great gift, and she determined she
would cultivate it assiduously and then—but
she had not yet quite decided what difference
the ‘then’ would make.</p>

<p>The Red Road Country had a little plain
church at the top of one of its hills, and Dot
led the singing as a matter of course.</p>

<p><a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>63<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Sometimes she took long solo parts in the
anthems, and then the ugly barn-like place of
worship seemed full of glory. Several times
people had come all the way from the shore
just to hear the clear, sweet, joyous voice of
that one little person in the front row. She
had been asked more than once to join the
choir of different big churches in Sydney, but
there was no train service at all on Sunday for
the line, and Larrie naturally refused to have
an empty house the greater part of the day
just because his wife had a voice. Choir
practices were on Wednesday afternoons, and
Dot attended regularly now; for one thing
they helped to pass the time, for another she
had a genuine desire to have the singing each
Sunday as good as possible, and knew her
presence stimulated the other members.</p>

<p>The Red Road Country is growing famous
for its healthiness. People with land to sell
in the district and the few boarding-house
keepers, advertise it as ‘The Sanatorium of
New South Wales.’ Doctors are beginning to
send their patients there occasionally, instead
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of to the Blue Mountains, and the
pure, gum-tree<!-- TN: original reads "pure gum-tree," --> filtered air certainly works
wonders.</p>

<p>Mr Sullivan Wooster had been sent up for
a month. He occupied a high position in the
musical world of Sydney. He taught, conducted
concerts, gave recitals of his own on
organ and piano, and composed pieces that
met with high praise in the old world. An
attack of pleurisy had prostrated him recently,
and he had come up to the Red Road
Country for his convalescence, refusing to be
sent to a more distant place. A Wednesday
afternoon came a week after he had arrived.
He was almost dying with the <i>ennui</i> of the
place; the abounding gum trees were beginning
to prey upon his very soul. He had
taken rooms at a cottage where the recommendations
had been ‘No children, beautiful
views, and a piano.’</p>

<p>But the daughter of the house had artistic
yearnings that she longed to impart, a passion
for waltzes, and a tousled fringe that Wooster
was always dreading to find detachments of
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in his custards. The healthful Eucalypt on
hill and dale comprised the view.</p>

<p>Naturally he spent most of his time on the
Red Road. When he heard voices in the
little church that afternoon, he strolled to the
door just for the urgent want of something to
do. When he heard Dot’s voice, he went in
and sat down in the extreme back seat, much
to the discomfiture of a nervous member of
the choir.</p>

<p>After the practice was over he shook hands
with the clergyman’s wife who had officiated
at the little organ. He knew her very well;
she had found these lodgings for him, and had
sent him tomatoes on one occasion and some
of her own orange wine, marvellously nasty
stuff, on another.</p>

<p>He asked after her husband, praised the
views, thought the weather would change,
said nothing bitter about the landlady’s
daughter, and offered to preside at the organ
the next Sunday. Then he asked to be
introduced to the girl with the beautiful
voice.</p>

<p><a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>66<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>A quarter of an hour later he was walking
home with Dot.</p>

<p>Her books—she had three of them—were
his excuse, and the fact that he had been
walking that way before he turned in at the
church. All the way they talked music.</p>

<p>Dot’s eyes were bright, her speech eager.
What a pleasant, unlooked for change this
was for her!</p>

<p>She knew him well by repute, as indeed
did everyone in Sydney—she had been to his
concerts, she played his compositions,—some
of her friends had been his pupils,—he seemed
more like an old than a new friend by the
time they reached the top of the second hill.
Half way down they noticed the gathering
clouds; by the time they reached the gate it
had begun to rain heavily.</p>

<p>Dot did not hesitate a moment. He had
been ill she knew: a wetting might prove
serious.</p>

<p>‘You must come in,’ she said, pushing open
her little gate, ‘come and wait till it clears.’
She preceded him up the path and sprang up
<a name="png.079" id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the verandah steps into shelter, shaking the
raindrops off her little short curls and
laughing breathlessly after the few minutes’
hurry.</p>

<p>‘What a <em>dear</em> little girl!’ he said to himself,
following with the utmost gladness.</p>

<p>He had never spent in all his life a
pleasanter hour than the next one.</p>

<p>His artistic eye was charmed with the
arrangements of the simple drawing-room, it
was a real pleasure to run his fingers upon a
good piano once more—here was all the
music that made the earth a happy abiding
place, and above all there was the presence
of the sweet little girl with short soft curls,
wide, eager eyes, and a voice truly wonderful.
Oh the beautiful hour it was!</p>

<p>They had both gone straight to the piano
as naturally as ducks go to water; they tried
whole pages of different operas together, and
went twice through some of the songs, just for
the sheer pleasure of singing.</p>

<p>Then he played some Beethoven she had
never found beautiful before, and after that
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>she played at his request piece after piece, and
he was surprised at her culture.</p>

<p>He almost feared once or twice that the
whole occurrence was an enchanted dream
which would fade presently.</p>

<p>On his knees at the Canterbury drawer he
found the score of <cite>Faust</cite> bent open at the
‘Jewel Song.’ He held it up eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Let me hear you in this,’ he said. ‘You
sing it?’</p>

<p>Dot nodded joyously and opened it on the
music holder as he took his seat.</p>

<p>She gave a little cough to clear her throat.
He stood up, real concern on his face, and
closed the book instantly.</p>

<p>‘There is <em>nothing</em> so culpable as over-tiring
the voice; it was criminal of me to let you sing
so much,’ he said.</p>

<p>There was a warm flush on her cheeks and
her eyes were brilliant.</p>

<p>‘Let us have some tea then,’ she said, with
an excited little laugh.</p>

<p>She crossed the room and rang the bell
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the fireplace. Quite a professional look
was on his face.</p>

<p>‘I do trust you take proper care of your
voice, Miss Armitage,’ was his really anxious
remark.</p>

<p>Dot’s eyes flew open, then she laughed
aloud just as Peggie appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>‘Tea, please, Peggie, and baby—baby first,’
was her order.</p>

<p>Peggie departed, surprised displeasure on
her face: she wondered who was the strange
gentleman her mistress was on such good
terms with, and she thought it most inconsiderate
that she should want afternoon tea
when there was so much ironing on hand.
But she slipped a fresh muslin pinafore on
the baby and put on his best little red shoes,
before she carried him in to them all warm
and flushed with his afternoon sleep.</p>

<p>‘I believe you thought I was only a girl,
Mr Wooster,’ Dot said with a merry laugh as
she stood up with her beautiful darling in her
arms for inspection.</p>

<p><a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>70<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Mr Sullivan Wooster was certainly looking
as thunderstruck as if the pretty bundle of
muslin, and lace and sweetness she held had
been a phoenix instead of the dearest little
baby in the world.</p>

<p>‘I never dreamt,’ he began. ‘I quite
thought—I certainly imagined Mrs Ingram
said <em>Miss</em> Armitage; as <span class="nw">well—,</span>’ his eyes
sought her little bare left hand.</p>

<p>Dot laughed that happy little laugh of hers
again. She went over to the Canterbury
and emptied a small Dresden cup upon her
palm.</p>

<p>‘I always take my rings off before I play,’
she said, ‘it’s a pernicious habit, I know; my
husband is always trying to break me of it,
but I really do it unconsciously. I never can
play properly with them on.’</p>

<p>After that, of course, he paid dutiful, expected
court to the baby, and made the
correct remarks about its eyes and long
eyelashes and the quantity of its hair. But
he no longer thought the occurrence an
enchanted dream that might fade any minute.
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The baby gnawing thoughtfully at its dear
little shoe as it sat on the hearthrug, while
Dot poured out tea, gave a surprising air of
reality to everything.</p>

<p>The rain had not ceased for a moment, so
there was good enough excuse for Mr
Wooster’s prolonged stay, but Dot was
greatly astonished to see Larrie come up
the path presently, and know it was half-past
five. She excused herself and slipped out to
meet him. He came in cold, wet, and cross.
It struck him how bright Dot’s face was and
how exceedingly beautiful she was looking as
she opened the door for him.</p>

<p>‘I have a visitor here, Larrie,’ she said in a
whisper, ‘be quick and get your mackintosh
off. It is Mr Sullivan Wooster and he is so
nice; don’t stay to change your coat.’</p>

<p>But ‘Confound him!’ said Larrie.</p>

<p>He wanted Dot and Dot only just now.
All the day he had had an unutterable longing
to take her in his arms and beg her to let them
start afresh, and make life a beautiful thing
again. And now there was a visitor here.</p>

<p><a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>72<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘You must ask him to stay for dinner, of
course,’ Dot said. ‘He’s had pleurisy and
can’t go home in the rain. It’s lucky there’s
roast fowl to-day, and I’ll open a bottle of
those apricots.’</p>

<p>Larrie was sulkily taking off his mackintosh
as she talked.</p>

<p>‘What the deuce brought him here?’ he
said. Dot said ‘H’sh,’ and gave him a little
poke to remind him of the proximity of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you after,’ she said. ‘I must go
back now, I’ve left him alone with baby, and
perhaps he’s not educated up to them.’</p>

<p>He went kitchenward to ask for dry boots,
and Peggie was dishing up. The appetising
smell reminded him he was too hungry to tell
her to keep things in the oven on the chance
of the visitor going. And as he went back
again up the hall he saw the weather was too
abominable to turn a dog out. But he said
‘Confound it’ under his breath outside the
door, as necessary preparation to pressing Mr
Sullivan Wooster to stay to dinner.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Larrie</span> had not yet taken Dot in his arms
as he had intended that afternoon, and he
had not asked her to begin afresh, so the
result was still ‘dead level.’</p>

<p>But Dot was no longer unhappy. Every
minute of her time was filled, and with a
real object now in life, she felt she had been
childish to waste so many hours in weeping
and dwelling on imaginary differences in
Larrie’s manner.</p>

<p>She began to teach herself Italian with
the aid of several grammars, text books,
dictionaries, and Mr Wooster.</p>

<p><a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>74<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>She practised the most uninteresting vocal
exercises with unwearied patience, and her
perpetual singing of scales made Peggie take
to a permanently closed kitchen door and remark
in confidence to baby that his crying
was music to it.</p>

<p>All this because Mr Wooster, musical critic
and composer, had told her that if her voice
was carefully cultivated and lost none of its
wonderful purity and freshness in the process,
he did not know any singer in Australia she
would not surpass, that her fame would be
equal in time to Melba’s or any of the first
singers of the day.</p>

<p>She did not tell Larrie this new wonderful
secret that made her heart sing even when
her lips were silent. She wanted to keep it
as a grand surprise to him, and in bursting
out on an astonished world to amaze him also,
and fill him with pride and gladness at her
power. He was so used to her voice, had
heard her chirping, and chirruping, and
trilling ever since she was five, and though
of course he loved it as he loved her, it had
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not occurred to him that she was extraordinarily
gifted.</p>

<p>Naturally he had heard praise and admiration
and considered them only her due, but
she had lived so quietly in this lonely Red
Road country, both before and after her
marriage, that she had never had the opportunity
of hearing really competent criticism
before. Even she herself had not dreamed
her gift was so rich.</p>

<p>Fond of singing she had always been, it
came as naturally to her as speech; she knew
she had the best voice in the district, but that
was not saying much; and sometimes when
she had been to concerts in Sydney it had
struck her that she could render certain songs
of the performers quite as well as they did,
if not better.</p>

<p>Mr Wooster’s words had been as a flash of
lightning illuminating all her future life.
What dreams she had over the piano as she
climbed to clear B’s and wonderful birdlike
upper C’s! How proud Larrie would be of
her, what fame should be hers, how they
<a name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>would travel with the wealth to come, and oh,
what a brilliant, beautiful future baby’s should
be!</p>

<p>She told Wooster that she wanted to keep
the secret from her husband at present,
and he smilingly acquiesced, so great was
her happiness in it. In asking Larrie’s permission
to give a few lessons to his wife he
only said, as twenty others had done before,
that her voice was very good indeed and
would be much improved by training.</p>

<p>Larrie gave his consent half unwillingly;
Dot’s singing he considered was quite good
enough for anything, <em>he</em> was quite satisfied;
but he saw it would seem churlish to refuse,
and Dot would take it as a fresh instance of
his ‘tyranny,’ so he allowed the lessons to
begin.</p>

<p>He was not half so happy as Dot in those
days. Poor Larrie!</p>

<p>It was very slow, unexciting work sitting
in a twelve-foot-square office all day, waiting
for clients who never came.</p>

<p>He had the feelings of an exile, too, whenever
<a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he thought of the dear little cottage
where the days had all been short and bright.
It seemed as if Dot had banished him from
the little kingdom because she was tired of
him, and it was real torture to him to notice
how light-hearted and happy she seemed
without him, while he was more miserable
than he had ever been in his life.</p>

<p>Dot could persuade herself both into and
out of anything she wished with happy
feminine ease. But with Larrie it was
different. He was long-headed and his
reasoning was nearly always excellent, but
when he had once planted an idea in that
head of his, it almost required an earthquake
to uproot it. That was what Dot stigmatised
his ‘aggravating obstinacy.’</p>

<p>He had upbraided her more than once for
having what he called ‘moods,’ not being
always the same to him, having the odd little
fits of coldness or petulance that most women
have occasionally, and can never explain
logically and satisfactorily. But Dot used to
retort that if she was subject to moods, he
<a name="png.090" id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had ‘tenses’ which were infinitely more
objectionable.<!-- TN: period invisible in original --></p>

<p>A matter that she would shed a few tears
over and then dismiss, he would brood over
until he worked himself up into a state of
positive wretchedness.</p>

<p>He really could not help himself, it was a
certain kink in his nature that made him so,
and the ‘tenses’ were times of misery both
to himself and Dot.</p>

<p>Once in the early days of the baby, he had
taken up the notion that Dot cared for it far
more than she did for him, she was so wrapped
up in it, and would spare him so little time
from it.</p>

<p>He had grown absolutely jealous of the
poor innocent little morsel, and so miserably
unhappy, that it had needed a domestic
cyclone and manifest neglect of the child
before Dot could bring him to a healthy state
of mind again.</p>

<p>He loved his little sweet wife with a
passionate fervour and devotedness, that only
one man in a thousand is capable of.</p>

<p><a name="png.091" id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>79<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>She was as necessary to him as the breath
to his lungs, the blood to his heart. Had it
been needful, he would have fought the whole
world single-handed for her sake and never
felt one of the scars.</p>

<p>But the very strength of his love made it a
little cruel sometimes, he demanded almost
too much of her and she could not always
understand or be patient with it.</p>

<p>And now there was a cloud gathering on
the domestic sky, and Dot with astonishing
blindness thought it was a new, wonderful sun
that was going to cast a warm, beautiful light
over everything again.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what <em>will</em> Larrie say?’ she exclaimed
in a fit of eager, childlike pleasure one afternoon
when she had sung the ‘Jewel Song,’ in
a way that even Wooster, carping critic as
he was, could pronounce none other than
perfect.</p>

<p>He looked at her tenderly, he nearly always
said ‘<em>dear</em> little girl’ to himself when she was
like that.</p>

<p>‘I think he will say he could not be prouder
<a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of his wife than he is,’ he answered. ‘When
shall you tell him?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, not yet,’ Dot said. ‘Not yet on any
account, electric shocks are the salt of life.
Imagine his face when I lay the programme
before him, “The Jewel Song—Mrs—Lawrence—Armitage.”’
Her eyes sparkled,
she gave one of her happy little laughs.
‘<em>How</em> I wish the battery was ready!’</p>

<p>Wooster was standing in the window
looking absently out.</p>

<p>He had a clear cut face, ascetic would describe
it, only women novelists are credited
with adoring that word. It was not the face
of a musician at all, at least it had not the
liquid dreaming eyes, and wide, massive,
brow framed in wavy hair that we conjure up
generally when we speak of a musician’s face.
It was monkish rather, the lips were clean
shaved and somewhat severe, the hair very
short and dark, and the eyes just now merely
thoughtful. They were brown in colour,
almost black on occasion, and had perhaps
even more variety of expression than most
<a name="png.093" id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>people’s eyes. In figure he was rather below
the average height but he bore himself easily.
‘I would rather you spoke to your husband,
Mrs Armitage, before the programmes are
printed,’ he said, unconsciously making
chords with his fingers on the window
ledge. It had occurred to him that perhaps
it was rather a bold step for his pupil to
be contemplating a public appearance without
her husband’s knowledge.</p>

<p>‘Not for <em>any</em> consideration,’ Dot said with
great decision. ‘All I am living for is the
programme surprise. He shall know two
days before the concert, not a second sooner.’</p>

<p>Wooster played a chromatic scale with
his thumb and second finger till he found the
dust on the ledge made them unclean. He
pocketed them and turned round.</p>

<p>‘He may consider I am abusing my privileges
in preparing to bring you out like this,’
he said.</p>

<p>But Dot cried,<!-- TN: original has spurious paragraph break here -->
‘Nonsense,’ with haste and impatience.
‘It is the last thing he would think of,’
<a name="png.094" id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>she said; ‘why, he will be delighted, of
course. He does not dream he has a wife
talented enough to sing in the Centennial
Hall before a mighty audience of all musical
Sydney.’</p>

<p>‘Then you really will not tell him?’</p>

<p>‘Is there a stronger word than “No?”
One absolute and irrevocable? If there is,
consider it said.’</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>‘Suppose my nervous prudence makes me
present him with the bagged cat.’</p>

<p>‘In that case,’ said Dot, ‘I should take my
revenge in flat A’s. Have you no regard for
me?’</p>

<p>He forgot the dust and played another slow
scale.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">May</span> had come in wet and blustering. The
gum trees waved wild mournful arms up to
dull skies, the cottage garden was flowerless,
green, and dripping. Even the creeping roses
that bloomed eternally, hung crushed and wet
or dropped their poor spoiled petals on the
spongy paths.</p>

<p>Three months ago the back paddock had
been a place of delight for the eye, all tall
waving lines of Indian corn grown for the
fowls, there had been poppies amongst it, real
scarlet English poppies that some one had
sown, as well as the white and pink garden
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>varieties. Dot had hidden there for fun one
light evening with baby in her arms, and Larrie
had sought her vainly for half an hour, it was
so tall and thick. And when he had found
her she had a wreath of poppies around her
head, and baby was stuck all over with pink
ones; the two had looked such darlings he had
picked them both up in his arms and carried
them all the way to the verandah hammock,
and when he dropped them in, had said with
breathless conviction,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div>‘There are none like them, none.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To-day in the paddock there were only
dead brown stalks and leaves, broken or bending
before the rain. The poppy days were
dead and the long light beautiful evenings,
things of the vanished summer.</p>

<p>Even the hammocks that had swung
invitingly in the sunshine, lay in tangled
heaps on the laundry shelf; the verandah
was in a flood, and gusts of wind and rain
blew into the house at every fresh opening of
a door or window.</p>

<p><a name="png.097" id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>85<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>There was an iron roof to the cottage, and
had not Dot’s enthusiasm been so great just
now, the ceaseless, melancholy drip and beat
of the rain upon it would have proved too
monotonous an accompaniment to her songs.
But in truth she hardly heard it. To-morrow
she was going to tell Larrie.</p>

<p>The morning post would bring her the
programme, and two days later the great
concert was to take place. She danced baby
round the house in her excitement, such hard
work it had been to keep her secret when
there had been no other thought in her head
for weeks.</p>

<p>She painted a delightful little picture that
to-morrow was going to frame.</p>

<p>The background was the dining-room with
the red curtains drawn, and a glowing log in
the open fireplace; she put baby on the rug
in his new pale blue frock with the short
sleeves, and Larrie in the big easy chair with
his feet on the fender and a pipe in his lips.
And since in mental pictures the brush may
depict thoughts, she drew him, thinking
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>anxiously of his income which the sudden
depreciation in the value of property all over
the colony was just now affecting greatly.</p>

<p>And then she was going to ask him to
take her to the big concert at the Centennial
Hall to show him the names on the programme
in a careless way.</p>

<p>And his face was to grow first amazed, and
then bright with pride and gladness, and
the rest of the evening they were to spend
in making plans for the brilliant future.</p>

<p>How delicious it was going to be! Her
heart was throbbing with anticipation, her
very blood seemed leaping in her veins.</p>

<p>But baby objected to be jumped up and
down in the ecstatic little way she was
treating him to; he gave vigorous signs of
annoyance, so she sank into her low chair,
and rocked soothingly. But she could not
keep silent when he said with such wise,
round eyes that he knew everything about
everything, and was as pleased as herself.</p>

<p>‘Bab-bab,’ he began encouragingly, and
hit at her with his dear little fists.</p>

<p><a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>87<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>And ‘He should be a little prince, he
should,’ was her deliciously inconsequent
answer, punctuated with kisses on his wee
nose.</p>

<p>‘Bab-bab-bab’—he tried to walk excitedly
up the front of her dress in a horizontal
position, and then make gleeful clutches at
her hair.</p>

<p>But the short little curls slipped through
his fingers, and he kept tumbling back in her
lap, a little heap of cuddlesome sweetness.</p>

<p>‘Little son, small little sweet, mamma’s
boy bonnie,’ she whispered again and again
and again, her face in his neck or on his soft
thick hair. That was her way of telling him
that all the rest of their lives was going to be
a bright golden dream, a triumphal march
through the world, over a carpet of rose
leaves and under a canopy of the bluest sky
ever stretched out.</p>

<p>The very way he rounded his eyes and
stuck his fingers in her mouth to be bitten,
and crowed ‘bab-bab,’ showed how perfectly
he understood and approved.</p>

<p><a name="png.100" id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>88<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>But presently he began to nod like a little
heavy-headed rose, and she nestled him up
close to her breast and sang softly, happily
below her breath.</p>

<p>Drip, drip on the roof fell the rain; splash,
splash in the path-puddles where the blown
roses were drowning; tap tap, at the misty
window panes.</p>

<p>There was a kink somewhere in the rocking-chair,
it made a not unmusical little
sound at each backward swing, marking time
to Dot’s low singing. Baby could not have
slept properly without that gentle jerk
between the rise and fall.</p>

<p>The logs fell asunder.</p>

<p>All Dot’s enchanted castles were building
in the red glow, now they rose up gloriously
with the blaze, and the gladness in her eyes
deepened.</p>

<p>‘Bab-a-bab,’ murmured baby sleepily, a
gleam of blue just peeping through the long
lashes to discover the noise. But the soft
singing bore him off again, and the rock,
rock, rock of the chair.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The lashes lay quiet again on the little
cheeks, one small hand uncurled from Dot’s
finger, and lay open on her knee. Again the
logs fell apart, again the castles grew glorious.
Baby’s hand curled up again, but the sweet
lashes were too heavy to lift.</p>

<p>Some one opened the front door, and the
sound of the rain grew louder, then the
<a name="png.102" id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dining-room handle was turned. Dot gave
a little whispered cry of surprise. ‘Larrie!’
she said, but so softly that baby’s hand never
stirred.</p>

<p>It was hours before his usual time, and
never before had he shortened his voluntarily
imposed exile.</p>

<p>She noticed how exceedingly wet he was,
there was not a dry thread upon him, the
water was even now pouring off him and
making a pool on the floor. Then she saw
the white passion on his face, the terrible look
of his lips, his eyes. She laid the child down
on the sofa cushions and went towards him
slowly, and with fading colour. What dreadful
thing was coming?</p>

<p>‘Larrie!’ she said, a frightened tremble in
her voice, as she put out her hands to touch
him. But the anger in his eyes deepened.
He went closer to her, he actually grasped her
roughly by the shoulders and shook her.</p>

<p>‘How <em>dared</em> you?’ he said. ‘How dared
you?’</p>

<p>She looked at him with parted lips and
<a name="png.103" id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>widening eyes. She could find nothing to say
so intense was her amaze.</p>

<p>‘How dared you?’ he repeated. He shook
her again to hasten her answer.</p>

<p>But she only said ‘I think you’re mad,’ and
caught her breath.</p>

<p>He saw he was wetting the shoulders of her
pretty pink tea-gown with his coat and took
his hands away.</p>

<p>The genuine surprise on her face disarmed
him a little, it even occurred to him for the
first time that he might have the inexpressible
relief of finding he was mistaken.</p>

<p>His eyes grew a shade quieter and he did
not speak for a minute.</p>

<p>In the brief interval wifely concern appeared
on Dot’s face. She put her hand on his wet
sleeve and tried to move him towards the hall.</p>

<p>‘Come and get dry things,’ she said, ‘<em>how</em>
wet you are!’</p>

<p>But he would not stir.</p>

<p>‘I want to speak to you,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘When you are dry,’ urged Dot, ‘it can
wait three minutes.’</p>

<p><a name="png.104" id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>92<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>He sat down on a chair.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ he said.</p>

<p>She sat down, too, just on the edge of the
sofa by the sleeping child. She was concerned
because a fly would hover round its face and
distract her attention.</p>

<p>‘I went to Bayley’s this morning to get
some notepaper printed,’ Larrie said, and
paused. But Dot seemed to find nothing
very remarkable in that, and looked merely
attentive.</p>

<p>‘There was a proof of <em>that</em> on the counter,’
he continued, and threw a sheet of old English
printing on pale green paper towards her.</p>

<p>She started up, vexation on her face.</p>

<p>‘Oh <em>what</em> a shame!’ she cried. She read
it through standing up, and the knowledge
that all the colours were straightway rubbed
out of her beautiful picture, made two curves
of disappointment show at her mouth corners.</p>

<p>‘Then it <em>is</em> your name?’ said Larrie, and
his voice sounded positively faint.</p>

<p>Dot brightened a little. ‘Of course it is,’
she said, ‘I wish you hadn’t seen it though;
<a name="png.105" id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I was dying to surprise you, Larrie.’ Then
she went up closer to him. ‘Aren’t you
going to kiss your own pocket Madame
Melba?’</p>

<p>She felt how flat the scene had fallen even
as she spoke, and was fit to cry at the disappointment.
Then she remembered Larrie’s
anger a few minutes back, ‘But what made
you so cross?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘How dare you do such a thing?’ he said,
his eyes beginning to blaze again, ‘how dare
you; this comes of letting that infernal
fellow come to the house so much.’</p>

<p>‘You mean Mr Wooster?’ Dot was beginning
to fear for her husband’s sanity.</p>

<p>‘It’s his concert, you are singing at his
instigation, you have kept it hidden from
me.’ His voice rose.</p>

<p>‘Of course I have,’ Dot said. Then she
spoke very slowly, ‘Do you really mean to
say, Larrie, that all this is because I am going
to sing on Friday?’</p>

<p>‘Friday!’ shouted Larrie, he had actually
not seen the date, so absorbed had he been
<a name="png.106" id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the sight of his own name on that green
paper, with Mrs prefixed.</p>

<p>‘Because I’m going to sing on Friday?’
repeated Dot.</p>

<p>With a superhuman effort he controlled
himself; he knew the impotence of anger.</p>

<p>‘Tell me <em>everything</em>,’ he said shortly, ‘and
stand there.’</p>

<p>Dot was moving towards the sofa again.
She came back to him to save time though
the tone was provocative; she knew that he
would have held her by sheer physical force if
she refused while he was like this. Then she
told him the very high opinion Mr Wooster
had of her voice; how he felt confident
she had but to be heard by competent critics
to be assured of success, how he had arranged
this concert to give her the opportunity and
how she had been keeping the secret just to
surprise him. He heard her to the end and
acquitted her of concealing it for any unworthy
motive.</p>

<p>‘But I should not dream of allowing you to
appear in public,’ he said, ‘so you can tell
<a name="png.107" id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Wooster as soon as you like that he must
fill your place.’ He stood up as if the matter
was settled, he even took off his hat and
remarked that it was wet.</p>

<p>But Dot had gone very white.</p>

<p>‘You mean to say, Larrie, that you would
try to stop me now?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘I mean to say I <em>shall</em> stop you, there will
be no trying about it,’ he answered.</p>

<p>His temper had not perfectly balanced
itself again, and that together with the unpleasant
dampness he was just beginning to
feel, made his speech somewhat despotic.</p>

<p>‘Your reasons?’ Dot’s voice was quiet,
dangerously so.</p>

<p>‘I do not care for my wife to sing in a
public place like that, I don’t approve of the
way the thing has been managed, I don’t
like you having so much to do with that
fellow, that is quite enough,’ he moved to
the door. ‘Where’s that old brown coat of
mine, I hope you haven’t given it away.’</p>

<p>But Dot was sitting on the sofa again,
fighting with herself far too fiercely to think
<a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of old brown coats, indeed, the question conveyed
no intelligence to her at all. Out of
twenty conflicting emotions, rebellion was by
far the strongest. She said, ‘I shall go, I shall
go,’ again and again and again in such stormy
whispers, that baby stirred and tossed the
linen antimacassar off his hands. Larrie had
gone to get dry.</p>

<p>‘I shall go,’ she repeated with strong
emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p>‘Bab, bab, bab,’ said baby softly. He
yawned deliciously and flung up his arms.</p>

<p>Dot gave him a hurried pat or two.</p>

<p>‘Go to sleep,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Googul,’ he answered insinuatingly. He
struggled into a sitting position and leaned
towards her. But she lifted him on to her
knee quite unresponsively. There was
nothing in her mind but Larrie’s command
that meant death to her rose-coloured dreams.
She hardly recognised baby’s presence at all.</p>

<p>‘He is not my master,’ she said aloud, her
eyes full of rebellion.</p>

<p>But ‘Yes he is,’ answered Larrie quietly, as
he came in again through the second door.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span> loosened itself from the other
pearls and dropped off the string of days into
the strange awful place where have fallen all
the days that have ever been. Thursday slid
along the thread, trembled and fell. Friday
moved on to fill its place. Such a little time,
and it too, and the things of it would be gone
beyond recall for ever.</p>

<p>Larrie had grown visibly thinner in the
short space. He was staking all the happiness
of his life on the issue of this. To him
the thing was almost terrible in its plain
simplicity. He had looked at it from every
<a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>point of view, had reasoned it out and thought
of nothing else, all through the two waking
nights and the long day between. And he
could only see two paths for Dot to walk in,
one that was right and would lead to happiness
once more, and one that was so utterly
wrong that she would step into it not carelessly
and unknowingly, but wilfully and with
wide open eyes.</p>

<p>It could only be love that would make her
do another man’s bidding rather than his.</p>

<p>From that second path he told himself
there could be no return.</p>

<p>Dot went about with a feverish look in her
eyes, and lips almost as set as Larrie’s own.
She was going to make this strike for her
rights, and in future have the independence
due to the nineteenth century married
woman.</p>

<p>Larrie spoke of the irrevocableness of the
step. To him it was as grave as life and
death. But deep in Dot’s heart was the
knowledge of her power over him. She
called to mind all the quarrels of their wedded
<a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>life—had he not always forgiven her? Even
the times when he had not been the first to
make up, her tears and grief had made his
arms open for her immediately. She only
whispered this to herself, it made her a little
ashamed to think of trading on it.</p>

<p>Then out loud she told her conscience
several things.</p>

<p>First, that this was only one of Larrie’s
aggravating fits of opposition, and when he
got over it and knew what a name she had
made for herself, he would be glad she had
not taken him at his word.</p>

<p>Second, that since her gift was so great, it
would be wrong not to give the world the
benefit of it, she remembered the scriptural
napkin-wrapped talent.</p>

<p>Third, that it would be sheer ingratitude
after all Mr Wooster’s trouble, to spoil his
concert at the last minute.</p>

<p>And fourth, that no one literally interpreted
that word ‘obey’ in the marriage service, now
that the equality of the sexes was recognised.</p>

<p>It was merely a relic of darker ages when
<a name="png.112" id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>woman had been little more than a chattel;
the progress of the century had made it
elastic, before long it would be removed
altogether.</p>

<p>On Friday they had eggs for tea. At least,
Peggie had put a stand on the table, with
bread and butter, and other eatables, but
they were both too agitated to do more than
crack the tops, and take salt and pepper on the
edge of their plates. This was to be the last
chance. Peggie removed baby, and looked
anxiously at the quiet young couple as she did
so. She was afraid there was something really
serious this time, so pale was her master’s face,
so brilliant Dot’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ Larrie said heavily.</p>

<p>‘I’m going,’ answered Dot. ‘I’ve got my
dress ready, and made all arrangements, it’s
too late to stop now.’</p>

<p>Larrie swallowed some tea and went even
whiter. This was the final wrecking of their
lives. ‘Dot, I <em>beg</em> of you to think of it again,’
he said.</p>

<p>She slipped from her chair and went to his
<a name="png.113" id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>end of the table. ‘Darling, let me go!’ she
said, ‘see, I beg of you—you could give in
and let me, and then it wouldn’t be disobedience.’
She put her arms round his
neck, her flushed cheek against his, ‘Dear
old Larrie, do! I have set my heart on it so!
do let me go happy, dearest, dearest!’</p>

<p>If only at that minute she had said she
would give it up, he could almost have let
her go, greatly as he disliked the publicity
for her, and the connection with Wooster.
But he could not help mentally finishing her
last sentence—‘Or I shall have to go unhappy.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t,—you must see I can’t,—how can
I, Dot? it is impossible,’ he said. But she
clung tighter.</p>

<p>‘Once you loved me too well to refuse
me such a thing, my husband, don’t let
me think I am so little to you now.’ He
tried to put her away, but her arms held him.</p>

<p>‘Darling, let me,’ she begged, ‘let me, let
me,’—the tears were running down her cheeks.
‘I will be so good afterwards, oh this is everything
to me, Larrie,—Larrie, don’t be cruel to
<a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>me, I must, must go—oh, darling, let me, let
me.’</p>

<p>He was making a promise to himself to be
kept faithfully, since he saw how very much
this was to her. If she would give in now,
say she would give in as a true wife should
to her husband, he would let her go, he would
even take her himself, for it would prove she
did not put that man before him.</p>

<p>‘Dot,’ he said, and lifted her on to his
knee and held her hands tenderly in his own,
‘you must obey me in this, can’t you see you
must, my darling? Perhaps I have been
harsh or unkind about it. Yesterday I <em>told</em>
you to obey me, now I <em>ask</em> you, my darling,
my little girl, Dot, little, little wife. Say you
will.’</p>

<p>But she only stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>He put his face down to hers.</p>

<p>‘Darling, think of our happiness, how can
we go on living if you persist in breaking up
everything like this. There <em>must</em> be a head,
Dot, in everything, there must be obedience.
What would a ship be without a captain, or
<a name="png.115" id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>soldiers without their chief, an office with no
one in authority? And the husband <em>must</em> be
the head of the wife. Darling, say you will
obey me in this.’</p>

<p>But Dot could not. All her pleading had
gone for nothing, why should she listen to
Larrie’s? She moved his arms away and
stood up, her eyes dry and bright again.</p>

<p>‘You have refused me the only thing I have
ever asked specially since we were married,
Larrie,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘You will stay?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘You profess to love me, and then you act
like a tyrant to me. Why should you always
have <em>your</em> way in things?’</p>

<p>There was a red spot on her cheek.</p>

<p>‘You will obey me, Dot?’</p>

<p>She walked restlessly up and down the
room. She moved some ornaments on the
mantelpiece and put the curtains straight
with trembling fingers. She remembered
she ought to be dressing even now. In two
hours the concert would begin, and if she
gave in her opportunity would be gone for
<a name="png.116" id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ever, and just because Larrie was obstinate
and stupid!</p>

<p>Baby’s ivory rattle, still wet from his
mouth, lay on the sofa. She picked it up
and put it in her work-basket. Then she
altered the position of two photographs on
the mantelpiece. She moved one of Larrie’s
silver cups—in it there was a green programme
crumpled up into a ball.</p>

<p>‘Dot, you will obey me?’</p>

<p>‘No, I will <em>not</em>,’ she said passionately. ‘I
am tired of being told to do things. I want a
little liberty as well as you. I will <em>not</em> spoil
my future just because you want to be a petty
czar.’</p>

<p>She crossed to the door. A flame sprang
up in Larrie’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘You will be sorry to the end of your life
if you go,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘No, I shall be glad,’ said Dot.</p>

<p>Peggie came in to know if they wanted hot
water, or if the master would have another
egg. She was really too anxious to keep
away.</p>

<p><a name="png.117" id="png.117" href="#png.117"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘I’ve got a nice brown one, laid to-day, sir,’
she said persuasively.</p>

<p>He shook his head impatiently. The
woman looked over to Dot, standing with
the door handle in her hand, ‘Shall I fetch
the baby for you?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Dot sharply.</p>

<p>So she went out to the kitchen again, and
looked grave as she lifted baby from his high
chair, where he was perfectly happy with a
saucepan lid and a tin spoon.</p>

<p>‘<em>That</em> obstreperous,’ she said, and sighed.
Then she added, ‘poor man,’ under her breath.</p>

<p>Someway she generally sided with Larrie
at such times, though she was devotedly fond
of Dot.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to dress,’ Dot said from the
door.</p>

<p>‘How do you propose getting there?’ He
did not look at her as he spoke.</p>

<p>She twisted the handle. ‘Of course I had
expected you would come. As it is I have
sent word to mother, she is coming down
in the buggy for me at seven. Mr Wooster
<a name="png.118" id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is going there for dinner, he will drive. No,
mother doesn’t know; I only said you couldn’t
come.’</p>

<p>Larrie got up and walked to the window;
he could not answer her.</p>

<p>She looked at his big square back for a
minute and the short-clipped curls on his
head. Then she turned and went away to
dress. Only a thin partition separated her
bedroom. He heard every sound as he stood
in the window, the opening and shutting of
drawers, the plashing of water, her hurrying
steps across the floor, the creak of the wardrobe
door. Every minute he thought she
would repent and come in to him, his own
sweet, small wife again; then the thought
became a hope, and when the wardrobe
creaked the hope died, and there was almost
a prayer instead. But the door opened and
she came in fully dressed.</p>

<p>It was her wedding dress she wore, the
white, trailing, exquisite silk she had knelt
beside him in at the altar eighteen months
ago. It was cut a little low now, and showed
<a name="png.119" id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her white, soft neck and chest; her arms were
bare between the shoulder puff and glove top.</p>

<p>‘Larrie,’ she said with a little cry, ‘oh, let
me, Larrie!’</p>

<p>But he stood still.</p>

<p>‘<em>That</em> dress!’ he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>In very truth she had not thought of the
associations of it as she had slipped it on to-night
in excitement and anger.</p>

<p>‘You—you know I had it made into an
evening dress,’ she faltered.</p>

<p>‘But for this!’</p>

<p>‘I had nothing else to wear.’</p>

<p>He turned from her one minute, then back
again, and looked at her with wrathful eyes.
He had a wild impulse to force her to stay, to
compel her to obey him by the superiority of
his physical strength. Was she not his wife,
his property, did she not belong to him till
death? He almost thought he would get a
whip and beat her, beat her savagely. She
would love him better he felt certain; he told
himself there was more truth than half the
world dreamt in the saying that wife-beaters,
<a name="png.120" id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>always provided they are neither drunk nor
brutal, are best beloved by their wives.</p>

<p>But he knew in a calmer mood he would
despise himself for doing it, and he felt, too,
how imperfect would be the victory.</p>

<p>‘You are going?’ was all he said, and ‘Yes,’
she answered.</p>

<p>Wheels sounded a little distance off, they
both knew what it was.</p>

<p>‘As surely as you go, Dot, you will repent
it.’ Larrie spoke slowly, quietly, his face was
deathly pale.</p>

<p>She was trembling from excitement, there
was a vague fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘What would you do?’ she said with a
little nervous half laugh.</p>

<p>‘I would never forgive you, never have
you for my wife again,’ he answered, and
his face looked as if he meant it.</p>

<p>She shivered a little, but held her head
proudly. ‘Perhaps you would be glad of
the excuse,’ she said, with a pitiful attempt
at scorn.</p>

<p>He did not speak. The buggy rattled up
<a name="png.121" id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to the door, they heard Wooster’s voice
checking the horses, the mother’s saying
she would not get out as it was so late.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you go?’ he said coldly, seeing
she stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>‘I—’ she said. It was the sound of a sob
strangling in her throat.</p>

<p>He would not help her though her eyes
were speaking imploringly. If he had put
his arms round her that minute and begged
her as at tea to stay, even now she would
have given it up. But he stood like a rock,
his face hard, his chin square, his lips bitter.</p>

<p>The bell rang, and Peggie’s heel-down
slippers went up the hall.</p>

<p>Dot moved a step nearer to him.</p>

<p>‘<em>Ask</em> me to stay, Larrie,’ she whispered,
and this time the sob would not be strangled.</p>

<p>But he turned right away from her.</p>

<p>‘I would rather die than ask you again,’
he said with passion in his voice.</p>

<p>‘Mr Wooster,’ said Peggie cheerfully.</p>

<p>She had quite beamed at the man when
she opened the door, the quarrel would have
<a name="png.122" id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to be smoothed over now a guest was
here.</p>

<p>But five minutes later Dot came out into
the hall, her train a yard behind her, a great
white fur-trimmed cloak around her.</p>

<p>There was a beautiful angry colour in her
cheeks, a defiant light in her eyes; but her
lips were saying smiling things. Mr Wooster
was behind with a roll of music and an
opossum rug.</p>

<p>Peggie watched them through the front
door and down the steps, she saw Dot lifted
in beside her mother and well tucked up;
she watched the buggy lamps flash passing
out of the gates and disappear round a curve
in the road. Then with quite a weight at
her kindly heart, she went in to see if the
‘poor master’ wanted anything. But he
was standing in the middle of the room with
folded arms, and such a look on his face,
that she shut the door softly behind her, and
went away.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was raining again, and there was that
sound of wind in the trees that only the
Australian bush knows. Eastward, stars were
out in the sky, but, from the south, blue-grey
masses were drifting up to the low rain cloud
that had put out all the lights of the southern
cross, and only left the two pale pointers.
An hour ago the sky had been blue, for there
was a great moon, but now the rain had
washed all the colour out of it, and it
was dull grey with midnight cloud banks.
On the cottage roof and in the garden there
<a name="png.124" id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were patches of pale light from the drenched
moon, but all the bush beyond was black as
death.</p>

<p>‘Don’t come in,’ Dot said.</p>

<p>She leaped down from her seat before
Wooster could put down the reins to open
the gate and drive in.</p>

<p>‘She’ll get wet,’ the mother cried.</p>

<p>But the white figure went hurrying up the
drive, all its long silken train down on the
wet gravel.</p>

<p>There was a lamp alight in the drawing
room, and a circle of white from it lay on a
pool at the end of the verandah. But the
long French windows were closed. Dot beat
on the window panes with wet fingers.</p>

<p>‘We may as well get home,’ said the
mother, seeing her safe. But Wooster only
picked up the reins.</p>

<p>‘Larrie!’ the sharp whisper came through
the rain to the gate; the little metallic sound
was made by her rings on the glass.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and Larrie drew her
into the room, the blind fell down from its
<a name="png.125" id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>113<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pin at the movement, and now there was only
a bar of light on the verandah.</p>

<p>‘It’s very cold,’ said the little mother with
a shiver. And Wooster turned his eyes away
and drove her home.</p>

<p>Dot went forward almost blindly towards
Larrie, but he moved backwards, and she took
two more steps but he fell back again. The
room was small and he was against the wall
now, but he put his arms behind him and
stood sideways; he knew she wanted to put
her head on his breast and cry. The attitudes
would have looked almost comic, only something
prevented it.</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t a success,’ she said with a great
sob.</p>

<p>He did not speak or move a muscle.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I <em>am</em> so miserable,’ she said. Her
arms went out towards the stiff figure, but he
moved again.</p>

<p>‘Larrie!’ she cried, exceeding longing and
misery in her voice.</p>

<p>But he let the cry die away into the midnight
silence and he let her drop down on her
<a name="png.126" id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>knees by the sofa and sob her young heart
out on the piled cushions. He had frozen
altogether during the hours of waiting.</p>

<p>Once she looked up during her bitter
weeping.</p>

<p>‘You are hard,’ she said, ‘cruel—like
a rock, what can I do? I was wrong, I am
sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn’t even succeed. I
was too miserable, oh, how cruel you are!
what <em>can</em> I do? I will do anything, <em>anything</em>,
oh, Larrie, Larrie, Larrie, don’t be hard, when
I’m down, Larrie, and broken, and sorry, and
miserable—oh, it is cruel, cruel.’ Her sobs
choked her, there were wet warm patches on
the green cushion, her eyes were drenched,
she was shivering with excitement and
misery. There was another great silence
broken only by her passionate weeping.</p>

<p>Then she lifted her head again.</p>

<p>‘I <em>can’t</em> bear it,’ she said wildly, ‘for God’s
sake, say something, I shall go mad if you
stand there like that any longer. How unmanly
you are!—oh, how cruel!—Larrie,
kiss me. Oh, darling, darling, forgive
<a name="png.127" id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>me—my husband, my darling, kiss me, kiss me,
<em>kiss</em> me!’</p>

<p>The last words died away with almost a
wail, for though he looked at her all the time
he did not move nearer to her and his eye
took no softer light.</p>

<p>Then she dropped her head on the
cushions again, with her arms flung round
them and he stood watching her, and away
down in the East the stars went out, and
the sickly creeping light was the new
dawn.</p>

<p>When Dot stood up she was stiff, and
chilled to the bone. She was no longer
sorry, all the aching for a loving word and
kiss had gone, she was only very very tired
and very cold. She looked at Larrie with
eyes heavy and indifferent, if he had come
and kissed her then she could not have
responded or warmed in the slightest degree.
She drew her wrap closer about her bare
neck and arms and shivered again.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ she said dully.</p>

<p>But he went and brought a rug from the
<a name="png.128" id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hall stand and put it around her before he
answered.</p>

<p>‘I think you had better go to bed now,’ he
said, ‘we can talk to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘No, now,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘It is very late,’ he put back the blind and
disclosed the grey struggling dawn. ‘It is
four o’clock, to-morrow will do.’</p>

<p>But she sat down on the sofa where the
green cushion was quite dry again.</p>

<p>‘If you have anything to say, say it now,’
she said, ‘it is too late for bed now, what is it
you are going to do?’</p>

<p>There was a curious look of suffering on his
face and in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘I think I had better go away,’ he said.</p>

<p>Dot only stared at him.</p>

<p>‘There seems no other way, I have thought
of everything; there is nothing else left.’</p>

<p>‘You mean separate?’ she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. She bit her lip, but was
surprised to find how easily she kept calm.
She waited for him to continue.</p>

<p>‘You could stay here—it needn’t be talked
<a name="png.129" id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of, your mother would look after you. I’ll go
to Melbourne or Coolgardie or somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘For always, you mean?’</p>

<p>‘We could see, perhaps it would look
differently afterwards—for the present I
mean—we can’t go on living together, and
I can’t see anything better to do.’</p>

<p>Dot’s eyes grew hard. ‘If you go,’ she
said, ‘I will never live with you again. But
I don’t ask you not to go.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is the best thing,’ he said, which
answered his own thoughts rather than fitted
in with her words.</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely. ‘When were
you thinking of going?’</p>

<p>‘To-morrow,’ he said, ‘to-day, rather. There
is no use in delaying—I arranged everything
to-night—last night.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ Dot said, ‘that is settled then.’
She pulled the cloak up tightly and rose,
then she loosened it again and sat down.
Her eyes were cold, her lips very firm.</p>

<p>‘Remember,’ she said ‘this is final. I
committed a fault—perhaps. I cannot do
<a name="png.130" id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>more than ask your forgiveness. Do not
think I shall be put away and taken back at
pleasure. Go—I would not put out my
finger to keep you, but never again so long
as both of us live will I be your wife in anything
except name.’</p>

<p>He sat down on the chair near the little
writing table, the light was full on his white
face and lips.</p>

<p>‘I can only see a little way,’ he said.
‘Later—say in some months—we will decide
further: feelings change wonderfully, perhaps
I shall look at your act—differently; if we
live together I can’t; it would always look the
same. It is best, I can see. We <em>couldn’t</em>
just go on living as before. I couldn’t, at
least, so I will go, for a time at any rate,
and you—you will be glad to be alone I know.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I shall be glad,’ Dot said with great
steadiness.</p>

<p>Baby’s portrait smiled at him from the
stand on the table.</p>

<p>‘There is the child, of course,’ he said
heavily.</p>

<p><a name="png.131" id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>119<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Dot sprang up. Husband had been so far
before child that she had forgotten there was
any one else in the world. But she remembered
now.</p>

<p>‘He is mine,’ she said, ‘mine, of course,
there is no question about that. What are
you thinking of? you can go if you like, but
he is mine.’ Her eyes glittered.</p>

<p>He had known this would be the worst
difficulty; him she gave up easily—gladly even,
but the child she would fight for to the last.</p>

<p>His anger came to white heat again.</p>

<p>‘<em>I</em> shall keep the child,’ he said slowly, ‘he
is mine equally, he will be better with me.’</p>

<p>Dot laughed hysterically. ‘The mother
always keeps it in these cases. I believe you
are going mad, Larrie.’</p>

<p>‘I believe I am,’ he said very quietly.</p>

<p>He pulled up the blind for want of anything
else to do, and the dawn struggled in and
took away the brightness of the lamp.</p>

<p>It was only this minute he had really meant
to keep the child, his first idea had been
merely to go away and leave them, not
<a name="png.132" id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>altogether, perhaps as he said, but until he
could find life bearable again.</p>

<p>But when he saw how quickly she consented
and how her only care was to keep
the child, he told himself he would move
heaven and hell before she had it.</p>

<p>‘I shall keep it,’ he repeated, ‘it is not a
question of a mother’s care, any nurse I get
will know more about it than you do—I
shall keep it. You have chosen your life,
you can go on the stage altogether if you like,
but I shall not let you have the child.’</p>

<p>In all he said he would not degrade either
of them by the mention of Wooster’s name,
but there was nothing else in his thoughts,
and only everything else in the world in hers.</p>

<p>A great weariness came to Dot, a weariness
of all her present life. She dropped her chin
on her hands, and stared out at the pale,
creeping light. Her heart was quite cold,
she did not seem to care about anything in
the world. She looked at Larrie and away
again. A tiny darn on her skirt caught her
eye and she stared at it fixedly.</p>

<p><a name="png.133" id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>121<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>It lifted all her tired thoughts back to the
day it was made and pushed the present out
of sight. It was her wedding morning, and
she had put on the dress, she remembered
she had said it was a ‘holy’ dress, it was so
purely white and billowy and beautiful.</p>

<p>And she had dressed very early, for Larrie
had been unorthodox enough to want to see
her before she came up the aisle to him.
And when she saw him coming up the path,
looking oddly uncomfortable in his tall new
hat and frock coat, she had flown down the
hall and into his arms. And at the same
minute the gate had clicked to admit a string
of relations eager to fall on the bride, and he
had picked her up in his arms, sweeping
train and veil and all, and whisked her upstairs
on to the landing to have her to himself
for the last few minutes before he had her
for ever. The darn had been necessary,
because in the quick passage up a fold had
caught in a splinter in the bannisters, made
by her travelling trunk.</p>

<p>To-night she saw Larrie looking at the
<a name="png.134" id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mud on the hem. She imagined herself
without the darn, without the dress, without
the wedding.</p>

<p>It was eighteen months out of her life,
that was all; all the wish she had on earth
just now was to wipe out that time and be
a girl again.</p>

<p>She had tried marriage, and it had been
a failure for them both; Larrie was right,
the plan he offered was the best to be found;
the vulgarity and misery of publicity she
could not have borne, but there was no
reason why they should not quietly set each
other free, and go on their separate ways
again.</p>

<p>There was the child of course. She knew
nothing about law and supposed Larrie had first
right, since as she had often said to him the law
always gave the man the best of everything.
And cold, utterly tired and miserable as she
was, she told herself she did not mind very
much. She could not put away those
eighteen months as if they had never been, if
the child was always before her eyes to remind
<a name="png.135" id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her of them. She promised herself she would
go to Italy or Germany with her mother and
give up her life to music, she had only failed
through nervousness and misery last night,
the future was full of glorious possibilities.</p>

<p>Larrie was speaking again, there was a look
of judicial fairness in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Since we have both an equal right to him,’
he said, ‘we will draw lots if you like.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ she said coldly.</p>

<p>‘Will you let me make you some coffee
first, you will be taking cold,’ he looked at her
quite without anxiety. ‘I can make up a fire
in the kitchen in five minutes.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said, ‘get some paper. There are
some backs of letters in the blotter.’</p>

<div>And wept (I heard her tears).’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">See</span>, they are ready,’ Larrie said. He had
folded the slips of paper up into two little
square pieces. ‘Will you draw or shall I?’</p>

<p>‘What have you put on them?’ Dot asked.</p>

<p>‘L and D,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘You could have put baby on one and left
the other blank,’ she said, ‘and then I could
have drawn one and left the other.’ She
gained half a minute by the statement.</p>

<p>‘It comes to the same,’ he said, and held
them out to her on the Japanese pen
tray.</p>

<p>But she looked at the little pieces as if they
<a name="png.137" id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had been dynamite; a faint colour stole up
into her cheeks, her eyes dilated.</p>

<p>‘Draw,’ he said.</p>

<p>She put out her hand and drew it back
again trembling like a leaf and empty.</p>

<p>‘Wait a minute,’ she said with a little gasp.
She covered her eyes for a second, then, suspiciously,
‘how do I know you have not
marked one so you may know it?’</p>

<p>‘If you draw it will make no difference,’ he
answered patiently.</p>

<p>She put out her hand again and touched
them, first one and then the other.</p>

<p>‘I <em>know</em> I shall draw the wrong one,’ she
said in a choking voice, she turned them over
and examined them with pitiful criticism.</p>

<p>‘What did you make this one narrower
than the other for?’</p>

<p>‘Is it?’ he said and looked.</p>

<p>His hand was not trembling at all, but in
his heart there was a great aching for his
little son.</p>

<p>‘I think I had better draw and have done
with it.’</p>

<p><a name="png.138" id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>126<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The quick movement of her hand again
showed her trust in him was not all it might
have been—her fingers closed and unclosed
round the wider piece. Her cheeks were
burning, her breath coming in little quick
pants.</p>

<p>‘Get it over, Dot,’ he said very gently.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes, her hand groped
forward, her face grew very white. Then
she unclosed her fingers and showed both
little slips lying in her palm.</p>

<p>‘I <em>won’t</em> do it that way,’ she said with
sudden passion, ‘as if he were a cushion in a
bazaar, or a lottery ticket. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, Larrie.’ She tore the
paper into a hundred fragments and looked at
him with wide, angry eyes.</p>

<p>‘But how shall we decide?’ he said heavily.
He put the little tray back on the table and
mechanically replaced the pens and paper
knife, the darning needle and broken bit of
coral he had emptied from it a few minutes
ago.</p>

<p>‘He shall decide himself,’ she said. She
<a name="png.139" id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>got up and went towards the door. ‘Write
two more pieces of paper, and he shall draw.’<!-- TN: closing quote invisible in original --></p>

<p>Larrie wrote L and D again with a heavy
J nib, and again folded them up; then he
followed his wife.</p>

<p>She was standing by the cot in an inner
room looking down at the little sleep-flushed
face. One little curled up hand was flung out
on the counterpane, the other, with a thumb
still wet, was drooped just below his chin.
Damp little rings of hair lay on his forehead,
his lips were apart, his long eyelashes motionless.
Larrie came in on tip-toe.</p>

<p>‘You can’t wake him,’ he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>She shook her head, there was almost a
fierce look in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘What will you do then?’ he asked.
And ‘Wait,’ she returned.</p>

<p>He brought a wicker chair to the bedside
for her, a stiff-backed one for himself.</p>

<p>They sat and watched in utter silence till
the sun kissed the grey dawn white. Then
the child stirred, flung off the blanket, sighed—and
<a name="png.140" id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>slept again. Dot had gone pale as
death, and even Larrie’s heart had beaten
faster. But they composed themselves again,
and watched without speaking. And blue
was born in the sky, and the white tossed
itself into cloud shapes that a wind drove
over the sky to the west. Away at the back
a gate banged, there was a sound of the contact
of a tin and milk jug on the verandah.
Then the gate fell to again.</p>

<p>Baby uncurled his hands, sighed and
changed his cuddled-up side position for one
flat on his back. Then he opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>‘Are you ready?’ Larrie said in rather a
thick voice.</p>

<p>But Dot looked at him indignantly. ‘Wait
till he is awake and knows what he is doing,’
she said.</p>

<p>He was laughing up at them, holding up
his arms. There was some soft fur at his
mother’s neck that he was convinced would
be good to eat, he had a desire also to pull
the crisp curls on his father’s head.</p>

<p><a name="png.141" id="png.141" href="#png.141"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>129<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘Goo—goo—goo,’ he said, with an impatient
kick and an adorable smile.</p>

<p>How white Dot was! How Larrie’s hand
trembled as he picked up the tray!</p>

<p>‘He is awake now,’ he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘Let them be quite even,’ Dot returned,
with an agitated look, ‘of course he will take
the nearest one.’</p>

<p>Larrie arranged them with mathematical
precision, then put the tray near the little
baby hands. For one wild second, Dot looked
away, she could not have watched, then a
low, mirthless laugh from Larrie recalled her
eyes.</p>

<p>The child had taken the two without
a moment’s hesitation, and stuffed them
instantly into his little open hungry mouth.</p>

<p>The diversion occupied some little time for
both knew that paper was bad for infantile
digestion, but the touch of humour about it
did not strike either, or divert them from the
tragedy they were bent upon.</p>

<p>‘How <em>are</em> we to settle it?’ Larrie said
wearily.</p>

<p><a name="png.142" id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>130<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Dot lifted the child suddenly up on the
pillow,—there was a look of resolution in her
eyes.</p>

<p>‘We will both hold out our arms,’ she said,
‘whomever he goes to shall have him; it is
the fairest way.’</p>

<p>They bent down to the little fellow, father
and mother, with faces that would whiten,
and arms that trembled despite themselves.</p>

<p>‘Come,’ they both said.</p>

<p>One little roseleaf hand buried itself in
Larrie’s curls, one clutched the fur at Dot’s
neck.</p>

<p>‘Come,’ they said again, and this time there
was a desperate look in Dot’s eyes.</p>

<p>He looked gravely from one to the other
and loosened his hold of their separate persons.
There was a thoughtful expression in his eyes
though his lips smiled. He half turned to
Dot, and the intense look of her mouth relaxed
faintly. But then suddenly he stretched
out his arms and with a rapturous little leap
flung himself at Larrie.<!-- TN: period invisible in original --></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a few days life was a confused tangle;
then to prevent themselves going mad, each
assiduously tried to pick out the beginning of
a new thread to follow.</p>

<p>Dot was up at the house, she had the little
sitting-room and bedroom of her girlhood
again, and she had sent to Sydney for a parcel
of new music.</p>

<p>Strange wisdom came to the little anxious
mother. That it was really a serious quarrel
this time she could not help acknowledging,
and at first could hardly restrain herself from
flying down to the cottage and upbraiding
<a name="png.144" id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Larrie vigorously. But then again she knew
her child had been to blame as well, and felt
that interference just at the present stage of
things would work harm. A little time apart
she told herself, would do them both good, so
she remained strictly neutral, and though her
heart ached sometimes at the sight of Dot’s
unhappy eyes and carefully smiling lips, she
made no obvious attempt to bring about a
reconciliation. She did not even throw cold
water upon Dot’s wild plans that embraced an
instantaneous sale of the house and a voyage
to Italy.</p>

<p>Dot had all the trunks and portmanteaus
in the house carried into her bedroom, and
began to pack her own and her mother’s
favourite possessions into them.</p>

<p>‘This might be useful on board,’ she would
say, putting in a huge workbasket or writing
desk, or ‘You would miss this, even in Italy,’
taking down an old print of the Madonna
and Child that had hung in her mother’s
bedroom as long as she could remember.</p>

<p>The family solicitor was visited. Dot was to
<a name="png.145" id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>come in to about £3000 by the terms of her
father’s will when she was twenty-one. She
arranged for a sufficient advance of it to take
her mother and herself to Italy.</p>

<p>‘You will like to go, of course,’ she said to
her mother, ‘you are losing your spirits
staying in this wretched place year after year.
Travel is just what you need, isn’t it now,
small woman?’</p>

<p>The mother acquiesced; she would like the
voyage very much, but she could not be
ready quite as soon as Dot wished. She must
have six weeks at least to settle about the
house and different business matters.</p>

<p>Dot chafed at the delay, she had wanted to
take passages in a boat that went the very
next week, and to leave any arrangements to
the solicitor, but the mother for once held
her own.</p>

<p>The cottage was to be let, but until a tenant
was found, Larrie was compelled to stay there
with the baby and Peggie who had thrown
in her fortunes with the child, and regarded
her master and mistress as being for the time
<a name="png.146" id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of unsound mind. She treated Larrie with
cold severity, and no words could express the
scorn she felt for the absent Dot. But on
the baby, she lavished all the tenderness of
her nature, and told it half-a-dozen times a day
that it was a poor deserted lamb, and if she
was the law she would handcuff ‘them two’
so fast together they could not move apart
the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>The third day of Dot’s residence at the
house, Mr Wooster came. He had called at
the cottage, but Peggie had informed him
her mistress was up at the house. So he
turned his steps uphill. Dot talked a great
deal and seemed in an excited mood, but he
had no suspicion of the real state of affairs,
and merely thought she was spending the
afternoon at her mother’s.</p>

<p>But he was staying in the district again for
his health, and when he came the next
evening with a promised book for the little
mother, she was there again.</p>

<p>She was sitting at a table with a quantity of
paper books and maps spread out before her.</p>

<p><a name="png.147" id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>135<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘I am deciding which way to go home,’
she said, in answer to his questioning glance,
‘you have often said I ought to study in
Italy.’</p>

<p>He thought she was doing it for a pleasant
mental recreation and only smiled.</p>

<p>‘We go in about a month. Did not mother
tell you?’ she said, and followed up a dotted
line through the Red Sea with a careful pen.</p>

<p>He looked the surprise he felt. So friendly
had he become with Dot and the little
mother, that he felt quite hurt to be so tardily
informed.</p>

<p>‘Mr Armitage is fortunate to be able to get
away,’ was all he said and there was a little
stiffness in his voice.</p>

<p>Dot went slowly overland from Brindisi to
Calais, then she looked up.</p>

<p>‘No, he is not fortunate,’ she said, ‘for he
cannot get away at all. I am going alone—at
least, mother and I are going.’</p>

<p>‘And your little boy of course?’</p>

<p>Dot yawned with discernible difficulty.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ she said lightly, ‘children block the
<a name="png.148" id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>road to success, besides I must leave him as
compensation to my husband while I hunt for
fame.’</p>

<p>He was too amazed to speak. Larrie had
struck him as certainly the one other man
in the world capable of fully appreciating the
worshipfulness of this dear little girl. And
to hear he was content to part with her like
this after only eighteen months!</p>

<p>He felt a sudden contempt for Larrie and
an overwhelming sorrow for himself; what a
very sweet little child she was with those soft
flushed cheeks and wide darkening eyes!
And to think there was a lifetime of hunger
for one man because he could never touch
one of those soft, boyish curls, and the other
who had all of her, held her so lightly.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you think it is a mad quest
after my failure,’ she said, finding him
silent.</p>

<p>But he disclaimed that. He was as assured
of her ultimate success as ever, and knew
that it was only through nervousness that she
had failed to win immediate recognition. As

 class="ns">[p </span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it was, several of the best critics had spoken
of her hopefully.</p>

<p>‘No, you will succeed of course,’ he said,
quietly. He did not look at her, he was
thinking, wondering whether he should be
able to do without travelling too when
Australia no longer held her.</p>

<p>Then he wished hair shirts were sold by
modern mercers, and thanked God she was
going. He talked cheerfully of the route,
advised the best places for study, the best
masters, offered letters of introduction, and
all manner of things.</p>

<p>The talk stimulated Dot, her eyes and
cheeks grew bright; two hours ago the ache
at her heart had been intolerable, but the
thought of Italy and music was easing it
greatly.</p>

<p>From her corner, her needle in a wee
muslin pinafore, the little mother looked at
them with troubled brows. This kind of
thing was inimical to the baby, to Larrie, to
all of them, she almost wished her little girl
had been born without music in her soul.
<a name="png.150" id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Then something made her catch her breath
and pale suddenly under the brown of her
skin. She had seen and interpreted the look
of strange wistfulness in Sullivan Wooster’s
eyes, and it made her heart grow cold. Dot
looking up from her plans met his earnest gaze,
and for some inexplicable reason blushed; the
little mother in the corner said ‘God’ below
her breath—she was not a woman of strong
expressions, but her thoughts had leapt to
terrible possibilities.</p>

<p>When Wooster rose to go, she went downstairs
with him; they had been all the evening
in Dot’s little sitting room.</p>

<p>‘You want me?’ he said half way down the
hall, for her large eyes were speaking. They
went into the drawing-room and he waited
for her to speak, hat in hand.</p>

<p>‘I do not think this place is good for you,’
she said gently.</p>

<p>He looked down at the little fragile woman,
her worn, lined face and great sad eyes were
infinitely beautiful to him.</p>

<p><a name="png.151" id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>139<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘No place ever agreed with me better,’ he
said, puzzled.</p>

<p>Her lips grew severe.</p>

<p>‘It does not agree with you,’ she said very
quietly.</p>

<p>Then he understood what the anxious eyes
were saying, and was inexpressibly shocked
that she should have guessed what he hardly
allowed himself to know. For a moment he
could find no words, he stood before her with
bent head and paling face, then he looked up
and saw grief and tenderness were in her face
as well as anxiety. Terrible though the thing
was, the little brown faced woman whom the
waves of life had so buffeted, was sorry for
him, her eyes grew humid, she put out her
thin, tiny hand.</p>

<p>‘It is not good for you,’ she repeated very
softly.</p>

<p>He lifted the hand to his lips and kissed it
reverently.</p>

<p>‘No,’ he said, ‘it is not good for me. I
will go.’</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dot</span> had picked up a book in morocco covers.
It was lying on the sitting room table with a
dozen others and she took it at random. The
little mother was persisting in bringing the
conversation round to the baby this evening,
for the new fear in her heart would not allow
her to let things take their own course any
longer. She dwelt on his hair, the funny
little habit he had of drawing in his lips, the
dimple that dented one little cheek just below
the left eye.</p>

<p>So Dot took up a book to show she was too
much occupied for conversation, but her lips
<a name="png.153" id="png.153" href="#png.153"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>141<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were trembling. They had hitherto eschewed
this subject entirely.</p>

<p>The book might easily have been any of
the twelve others, but it happened to be
Browning. She turned over the leaves, then,
as that mechanical action did not quieten the
little mother, she was forced to read.</p>

<p>And the very words Larrie had marked for
her once quite years ago when they had only
been engaged and used to play at quarreling!
It was a finger nail mark and ran along one
whole verse.</p>

<p class="noindent">A great tear splashed down upon it. Dot
wiped it off with a hasty hand, she was angry
because the coldness and bitterness around
her heart were melting. But two more fell,
and two again, a host of little sweet recollections
<a name="png.154" id="png.154" href="#png.154"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of their married and unmarried life
came thronging unbidden. How could she
bear life if on every hand episodes of the
dead days were going to rise up in this
way?</p>

<p>Dear tender eyes watched her from the
corner.</p>

<p>‘He looked ill, my darling,—as if he had
not slept or eaten for a week,—I saw him at
the <span class="nw">station—</span>’ the soft voice paused for a
minute.</p>

<p>‘It is nothing to me,’ was the cold, piteous
answer.</p>

<p>‘He hadn’t his obstinate look at all,—when
he saw me he looked suddenly as if he was
going to cry, then he turned round and
walked up the road again quickly.’</p>

<p>Dot saw his face, the quick softening of
his mouth and eyes. She could hear his very
footsteps going away.</p>

<p>‘I shall never forgive him while I live,’ she
said, but she had crept round to the chair in
the dim corner and was feeling for her
mother’s arms.</p>

<p><a name="png.155" id="png.155" href="#png.155"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>143<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>They drew her down, down,—two women
were rocking and crying just out of the reach
of the lamplight.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were hurrying
down the hill to the cottage. Dot’s eyes
were tender, the great peace of forgiving was
in her heart; she was going to her husband,
the one man in the world who was all her
own and God-given,—between them what
question could there be of pride?</p>

<p>Two hundred yards from the gate she
stopped, there was a fallen tree worn smooth
with years of sitting upon.</p>

<p>‘Wait here, little mother,’ she said; ‘let
me go alone. Then we will come back and
fetch you.’</p>

<p>She pressed on by herself, a tender smile
parted her lips. Larrie thin and sleepless!
Larrie aching for the touch of her hand—Larrie
whose love was so desperate he could
not help being cruel!</p>

<p>She crushed herself through the broken
palings at the bottom of the bush paddock,
then she crept along in the shadow of the
<a name="png.156" id="png.156" href="#png.156"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>trees, up through the garden till voices floated
down to her and stopped her. Laughter came
from the verandah and smoke, and there were
two decanters on a little table, with a flickering
lamp.</p>

<p>Larrie was entertaining two bachelor friends
and was holding a pipe with one side of his
mouth, and with the other telling a late
witticism of a Supreme Court judge. The
men had come up about taking the cottage,
and almost suspected a domestic crisis; Larrie’s
forced spirits deceived no one but Dot in
the shadow of the pepper trees.</p>

<p>She felt frozen with shame and horror.
This was the man she would have humbled
herself for! She turned to go back in silence
the way she had come. But on the verandah
there was a sudden movement; someone had
discovered it was half-past eight, and being a
Thursday evening the last train went down
in eight minutes. They had their hats
and sticks in ten seconds, and were halfway
down the path. Larrie went with
them.</p>

<p><a name="png.157" id="png.157" href="#png.157"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>145<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘I’ll see you safe in,’ he said, ‘we’ll have
to run for it.’ His shadow fell at Dot’s feet,
then raced him down the road leading to the
station.</p>

<p>Dot breathed freely once more, then with
steady steps she went up the path and round
the verandah to Peggie’s window.</p>

<p>The woman was on her knees by the bedside,
reading the <cite>Bulletin</cite> by candlelight.
She always abstracted it from the dining-room
on Thursdays, the moment Larrie laid
it down, for she had a strange passion for
political caricatures, though to her knowledge
she had never seen a Member of Parliament
in her life. To-night she was convulsed over
a minister of the crown portrayed in an eye-glass
and ballet skirts.</p>

<p>Dot crept in through the back door and
went on tiptoe down the hall to the second
room there. She made a warm bundle of
the baby with the cot blankets and a New
Zealand rug, then she went out into the hall
again, holding it close to her happy breast.
Larrie had left the front door just ajar, so she
<a name="png.158" id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stole out noiselessly and walked down the
path to the gate.</p>

<p>The next minute she was fleeing up the
road again to her mother, the burden in her
arms the lightest thing in the world.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was half-an-hour before Larrie came back
and found the tossed, empty cot. He strode
out of the house again, and up the hill in a
fury of passion.</p>

<p>Out of the train into which he had seen
his friends, Wooster had stepped and gone
at quick speed, straight up the road leading to
the house. Larrie was not to know it was
intended for the last visit of a lifetime. He
resisted the inclination to follow and slay
him outright, and went home instead—to
find Dot had been there and taken away the
child.</p>

<p><a name="png.160" id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>148<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>A second jealousy sprang up in his heart,
jealousy of his own little baby son. He could
imagine the pass to which Dot had come,
imagine the heart hungerness that had
prompted this. But it was all for the child—none
of the aching and longing had been for
himself. The front door of the house was
open, he went straight through the hall and
upstairs two steps at a time to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Dot was sitting rocking alone in the firelight;
the little mother had gone to a sudden
case of illness in a cottage near, and Wooster
had taken her.</p>

<p>The child’s little soft head lay against her
breast, she held both its bare little feet in her
hand. There were tear-wet places on her
cheeks, and the eyes that looked down on
the child were full of tenderness, but her
lips were rather tightly closed. She could
not forget the verandah, and Larrie’s burst of
laughter.</p>

<p>He strode across the room.</p>

<p>‘Give me the child,’ he said.</p>

<p>Her arms closed tightly round it.</p>

<p><a name="png.161" id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>149<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>‘He is mine, mine,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Give him to me,’ he cried again.</p>

<p>She sprang to the door her eyes gleaming,
her hands holding the little soft body with
desperate firmness. But he was before her,
he looked down at her with white face, and
eyes blazing with scorn.</p>

<p>‘You are not fit to hold him,’ he said.</p>

<p>She was moving across to the second door
clasping her burden convulsively.</p>

<p>‘I will die before you shall have him,’ she
said passionately.</p>

<p>‘No you will not,’ he said.</p>

<p>His words came slowly, there was a horrible
note in his voice, ‘There is—your lover, you
know.’</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him, incredulous
horror in her wide eyes, her arms loosened
their hold a little, she went a step towards
him. But the light of madness in his eyes
increased, he tore the child from her arms,
and carried it away with him out into the
night.</p>

<p class="fivestar">· &nbsp; · &nbsp; · &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>

<p><a name="png.162" id="png.162" href="#png.162"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>150<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>He went slowly down the hill he had come
up in such wild haste. He had not felt the
night wind before, but now it blew chillily on
his burning forehead and quietened the fever
in his blood. He took off his coat and
wrapped it round the child, which lay warm
and sleepy and quiet against his shoulder all
the way.</p>

<p>There had seemed to be a strange wheel
working in his brain lately, it had gone at a
maddening rate during his short interview
with Dot. But something in the great hush
of the grey-blue night stopped it for a time
and a sudden calmness and power of reasoning
came to him once more.</p>

<p>When he reached the cottage he put the
child down again in the cot and covered it up
warmly. Then he walked about staring at
his misery. He knew it had grown utterly
past bearing. Everything in the place spoke
of Dot, spoke loudly and insistently, the
silent piano, the dead flowers in the vases,
the foolish little red watering pot on the
verandah nail, the small garden boots in the
<a name="png.163" id="png.163" href="#png.163"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hall corner with the red clay of the roads
dried on the heels. When he poured out his
coffee at breakfast time he shuddered because
he saw beside him the little dear bright face
that was not there—when he helped himself
to an egg he could not eat it, because the
stand held only two, instead of the by custom
sacred three.</p>

<p>That was the warm old jacket on the
second hall peg that she always slipped on, to
sit outside with him for his smoke, the big
poppy trimmed hat beside it, still kept the
shape of her head in its crown. He could
not get away from it all. His eyes too refused
to give up the picture of her they had seen
to-night, the tender innocent face, the pure
eyes, the trembling lips. Half-past ten
brought the very end of his endurance, his
bitterness and his unbelief.</p>

<p>It had taken all these six days for his brain
to grow clear and healthy again; with the
lifting of the strange cloud came the sudden
horror of the thing he had done, a shame at the
shame he had heaped on her. He found
<a name="png.164" id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>152<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>responsibilities that were his, he remembered the
tenderness and watchfulness and love which
her eighteen years demanded, he saw with
lightning clearness that it had been sheer
insanity that had distorted a simple friendship
and shamed them both.</p>

<p>He took up his hat to go out again. He
would go and beseech her forgiveness though
he told himself of course, she could not
possibly give it. Still he would entreat her.</p>

<p>Then the strange wheel began again in his
head, and as he walked a new hot swinging
sensation there, made him almost unconscious
of what was going on for minutes together.
He took off his hat and went on blindly, there
were two shrinking figures in the shadow by
the fence but he did not heed them.</p>

<p>He knew quite well now what was going
to happen to him, he was getting that same
brain fever again, he had had two years ago;
it accounted for everything.</p>

<p>He found a strange comfort in the knowledge.
He was going to Dot—by the time he
got to the lights and voices of the house he
<a name="png.165" id="png.165" href="#png.165"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>153<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>knew his senses would have gone and his illness
come upon him, his danger would touch
her little tender heart and she would forgive.
He even saw a vision of his convalescence and
white beautiful days beyond.</p>

<p>Then he came to the lights and people of
the house, and before the little mother could
speak a word, the danger came upon him and
the need of forgiveness.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dot</span> felt the emptiness of her arms. Then
she remembered the bitterness and horror of
her humiliation.</p>

<p>To nearly all human beings there come
during the course of life some moments of
complete madness and irresponsibility—Dot’s
came upon her now.</p>

<p>She was on her knees by the window;
sometimes she beat her head against the
wood-work—wild tears were coursing down
her cheeks, sobs of impotent anger choked
her.</p>

little mother had sent him to say good-bye,
and to tell Dot she could not leave the sick
woman for an hour. The sitting room door
was open.</p>

<p>‘Great heavens!’ he said, and sprang to
her side in alarm, ‘you are ill—God!—what
is the matter with you?’</p>

<p>Her sobs ceased, she turned her head and
regarded him strangely, her eyes wet and
brilliant seemed to pierce him. Then she
laughed the most terrible little laugh in the
world. ‘Why, you do love me after all!’
she said.</p>

<p>He fell back against the wall, utterly undone,
his eyes seemed the only living part of him.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t believe him,’ she continued in the
same tone.</p>

<p>‘Who?’ his lips said, after a long pause.</p>

<p>‘Larrie.’</p>

<p>‘My God!’ he cried.</p>

<p>He could hardly breathe, the figure kneeling
by the window was only a confused blur to
him.</p>

<p><a name="png.168" id="png.168" href="#png.168"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>156<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The choking sobs began again.</p>

<p>He walked up and down, wildly.</p>

<p>‘Where is your child?’ he said, stopping
at the end of the room.</p>

<p>She sobbed, and laughed and choked.</p>

<p>‘He took it, he has taken everything, and
isn’t it queer, I don’t care in the very least?’</p>

<p>He stayed at the end of the room, the table
and several chairs between them.</p>

<p>‘He thinks I love you?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes.’</p>

<p>She began to beat her head again.</p>

<p>‘Stop—how can you—for God’s sake, stop!’
he was at her side, trying to draw her from
the cruel wood.</p>

<p>‘I believe you love me as much as he did at
first,’ she said—he was offering her a handkerchief
for the little bleeding wound on her
head, and had to look at her—‘Don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘My God, <em>no</em>,’ he burst out, ‘what are you
dreaming of?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but you do,’ she cried, and laughed
again.</p>

<p>He had moved her from the wall and she
<a name="png.169" id="png.169" href="#png.169"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>157<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>could not beat her head. She got up from
her knees, and went nearer to him.</p>

<p>‘I wish you would take me away,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Remember you have a husband,’ he
answered, very coldly.</p>

<p>There was a scarlet colour on her cheeks, a
very fire in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘No, I have not, he has cast me off, I have
no one, no one, oh, you <em>might</em> take me away,’
her voice broke into a cry.</p>

<p>‘Where?’ he said, and trembled violently.</p>

<p>‘Anywhere, <em>anywhere</em>, just so I can never,
never see him again as long as I live.’</p>

<p>He moved towards her, all his strength had
gone, he was shaking like a leaf. A minute
ago he had been one of the best men on God’s
earth. Now, the suddenness and awfulness of
the temptation swept everything away for the
time but overmastering love for this woman.
He put out his hand.</p>

<p>‘Come,’ he whispered.</p>

<p>Two minutes later they were fleeing together
down the long Red Road that Larrie
was coming up.</p>

<p><a name="png.170" id="png.170" href="#png.170"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>158<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>They passed him half way, he was carrying
his hat, and going straight forward, not looking
to right or left.</p>

<p>The meeting only added fuel to Dot’s fire.</p>

<p>‘Hurry,’ she cried, pressing on breathlessly,
‘hurry.’</p>

<p>When they neared the cottage she was
limping wretchedly. He stopped suddenly
and looked down at her little house shoes.</p>

<p>‘The heel has come off,’ she said dismayedly.</p>

<p>It was really a catastrophe, for they were to
have gone two miles further, and then tried to
get a conveyance of some sort.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I could walk without them,’ she
said, and slipped one off, ‘Oh, do come on.’</p>

<p>There was a light burning in the dining-room
window of the cottage.</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t you go in and get a pair?’ he
asked, but she shuddered and shook her
head.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid,’ she said—‘of Peggie.’</p>

<p>‘Sit down here then,’ he said, and found
her a seat on some piled wood by the roadside.
‘I will try to take the other heel off.’</p>

<p><a name="png.171" id="png.171" href="#png.171"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p </span>159<span class="ns">]<br

<p>Peggie herself was leaning over the little
side gate fifty yards away, and the figure of
the district butcher was discernible on the
footpath.</p>

<p>‘You could go in yourself,’ he whispered,
‘and get wraps as well.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid,’ she said again, and looked
at the lamplight with strange eyes. ‘There’s
a pair in the hall stand box.’</p>

<p>He opened the gate very quietly and went
over the grass; she saw him push open the
half closed front door, and go into the hall.</p>

<p>Peggie’s voice came over the garden beds.</p>

<p>‘Get out with you,’ she was saying to her
lover. Dot watched her with frightened
eyes, for no quick shadow fell on the lighted
patch near the door.</p>

<p>How long he was! Perhaps he could not
find the shoes, perhaps Larrie had flung them
out. It might be he was looking for another
wrap for her.</p>

<p>‘Ga’rn,’ said Peggie, ‘I’m goin’ in.’</p>

<p>But Dot trembled needlessly, she did not

 class="ns">[p </span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>move. The frilled curtain blew through the
drawing-room window in its old accustomed
way; the broken wistaria lattice swayed and
creaked as it had done for months. Something
rose in Dot’s throat, the wildness died
out of her eyes.</p>

<p>Then the long shadow fell on the lighted
patch, and he came across the grass again,
straight over the mignonette bed and Larrie’s
primroses.</p>

<p>She shivered violently, a sick feeling of
fear came over her. He was speaking to her,
bending down to her, she could not see his
face in the darkness, but she knew he was holding
something in his arms. He put it gently
down on her knees. How warm it was, how
soft, how very small! Such a little pitiful
cry of broken sleep it gave!</p>

<p>‘Oh, God bless you!’ she said, ‘God bless
you!’ There came a rush of warm, relieving,
grateful tears.</p>

<p>‘Oh, God bless you!’ she said again. But
he had gone.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
